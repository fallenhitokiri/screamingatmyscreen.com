â€¦ so we put a downloader in your download to download a downloader to download the application you want. I have to admit that I do not like Adobe but they managed to move the current trend of downloading an application to download the application you want to a whole new level of stupidity.

If you want to install Photoshop with the current Creative Cloud system you have to login on the website to download Creative Cloud Desktop (let us call it CCD), you get CCDsetup. After that you download the CCDinstaller with the CCDsetup. When the download of CCDinstaller is finished CCDsetup notices that it is not running with administrator privileges, closes itself and gives you an error.

Rerun the program with sufficient privileges so it can download the whole setup **again** and install CCD. Now after you login in CCD you can download and install the Adobe application you want.

You could argue that this makes perfectly sense so your apps are up to date and synchronization with the cloud and stuff. But if you look at all the other tabs besides "application installation" in CCD the only thing you see is "coming soon". Not to speak of the fact that the last thing I want is anything else beside the apps from Adobe.

Look at Steam for example. It consolidates installations and the buying process from dozens of different vendors. This safes a lot of time, especially since buying games is a more frequent activity than buying Creative Suites.

I already have to create an account and enter my payment details, CCD does not save me from this. I upgrade once every year or every second to the next major release of Photoshop and the other apps. Login, download two or three different applications - if you do not just go for a suite - run a setup and done. No need to have another application in the middle of this process.

So I downloaded a downloader to download a setup wich installs a  downloader to download and install applications. Welcome in 2013.

I believe that learning new skills is essential. No matter if it is in your job, your
private life, just for fun without any reason - not learning new tricks means you stand 
still, do not improve, do not get better, nothing. Is there anything that sucks more?

There is currently a [code challenge][1]. The idea is that you use a new language or
toolkit and create something. Even if it is simple, even if it has no real use, just
for the sake of learning. Great, isn't it?

There are several things I consider. First and most important would be the framework and
language. Since "casually messed around with" is included I have some choices.

I consider [Meteor][3] or [node.js][2]. Something new, JavaScript based. I could, just
one time, be on the hip site of technology,... Just polishing my Ruby skills would
be boring.

On the other hand something Cocoa based would be another good idea. I will have to write
a lot more code on Objective-C and Cocoa the next few months, so why not using the code
challenge to improve my skills?

No matter what I will use or what I will build I will keep you updated.

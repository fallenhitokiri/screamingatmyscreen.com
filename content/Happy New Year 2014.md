I hope you all had an awesome start in this new year and that you have the chance to do something awesome and exciting. As regular readers know I think of "new year resolutions" as something worthless. If you want to change something you should start now, not on an arbitrary date.

But not having any life changing plans for 2014 does not mean that I have not planned some projects for this year. I want to give you a quick idea what you can expect to see the next 12 months.

- a new version of drupan will be released making the generation of blog unrelated sites a lot easier
- an entirely new blogging platform - if you read my past CMS rants you could figure out what it will look like, but I will also blog about it the next few days
- I will publish my first book
- currently it looks like a side project could turn into a service I open for everyone, maybe release it on GitHub, not aiming for profit

Enough ranting for the first day of the year. Stay as awesome as you are and do something extraordinary!

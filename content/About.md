Hi, I am Timo Zimmermann and this is my private domain. I was born in 1986, want to school, graduated and did not even t

###History lesson
I was born in 1986. I started my first business when I was 16 years old. It was a small
company focusing on teaching. Teaching companies how to use new technologies like
wikis, groupwares and other new web 2.0 stuff.

This does not mean that I am uneducated. Well to be honest I am since I did not learn
anything in school that really helps me in my life but I completed my diploma.

When I was 18 and were still occupied with school I started an in-service training as
financial consultant at Deutsche Vermoegensberatungs AG.

Since I finished school I am working as a self employed financial consultant.

On Christmas 2011 I was talking to my girlfriend, my oldest friend and my parents. I
had the feeling that I have to change something and do something new. Something I love,
something I can do the whole day and still enjoy it. In January I founded [blazeit][6].
I am back in the IT business and enjoy every minute.

###Private
Beside work and school I also got some hobbies. Sometimes I even manage to 
squeeze them in between other stuff.

As you could have noticed - IT. Mostly new and exciting products. I am a usability 
junkie so I prefer Apple equipment. This does not mean that I would not get my 
hands dirty with some *nix boxes or even boot Windows to play some games.

I practice martial arts for 12 years now. I started with Karate, went to Taekwondo
and Aikido and also visited some friends to train Kung Fu.

I enjoy evenings with my girlfriend or just my friends, a good movie or some TV shows
and from time to time a good book. I was never in discos or a fan of loud and 
crowded places with drunk people. Pretty boring, I know,...

##Hopelesscom
I started my private site around 2002. Hopelesscom was a domain I registered for
a WiFi wiki that never made it live and at some point I started using it as my private
domain. Even if I am not pretty happy with the name it works fine for many years now.

In 2011 I developed a blogging software called [Zenbo][1]. It is a static site generator.
You write your text files in markdown run Zenbo and after some Python and Git
magic your site is online. You only need a webserver. I prefer Lighttpd. I do not have
to care about bugs and security problems in Wordpress (my previous software) and
just have to make sure that my webserver is up to date. No resources wasted for a
database that is basically only a worse text storage solution or PHP which is still
known for,... well, same argument again, security problems.

###Links, Opinions,...
Everything you find on this domain is my opinion. If you click on a link I have nothing
to do with it. If someone hijacks a domain and starts publishing stuff that should
obviously be something else I would appreciate a short notice.

##Screamingatmyscreen.com
In the third quarter 2012 I switched my main domain to screamingatmyscreen.com. More on this will follow ;)

##Web 2.0
As you might have guessed I have several accounts across various social network sites.

 * [Twitter][2]
 * [Tumblr][3] - photos, short notes and much more - everything not important enough for my blog
 * [Tumblr][4] - gaming blog
 * [Youtube][5]

There is no point in searching me on Facebook. I only add people I meet on a regular
basis and I would shake hands with when I meet them. If you do not have me on your
Facebook friend list it is likely that you do not belong in this category.

###Contact
If you cannot guess how to contact me now or if you are a known Web 2.0 hater you
can send a mail to timo (aet) hopelesscom (doet) de or a letter

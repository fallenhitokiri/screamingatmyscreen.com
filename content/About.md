Hi, I am Timo Zimmermann and this is my private domain.

*this is currently in work*

## Web 2.0
As you might have guessed I have several accounts across various social network sites.

 * [Twitter][2]
 * [Tumblr][3] - photos, short notes and much more - everything not important enough for my blog
 * [Tumblr][4] - gaming blog
 * [Youtube][5]

There is no point in searching me on Facebook. I only add people I meet on a regular
basis and I would shake hands with when I meet them. If you do not have me on your
Facebook friend list it is likely that you do not belong in this category.

### Contact
If you cannot guess how to contact me now or if you are a known Web 2.0 hater you
can send a mail to timo (aet) screamingatmyscreen (doet) com or a letter

    <p class="meta">posted on February 05, 2012 in <a href="/tag/development/">development</a>, <a href="/tag/editor/">editor</a></p>
    <h1>A New Editor</h1>
    <p>In my <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/1/7/feature_flood.html">last</a> <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2011/12/18/the_holy_grail__a_programmer_s_editor.html">posts</a> I mentioned that I was evaluating some editors. 
Again. The basic problem is that I just cannot stand vims modal editing and 
look &amp; feel, even AquaMacs does not change this. Sadly I also cannot stand the
alternatives. Till now. I think I found an editor I really can live with. It 
was suggested by some people I know but I did not get why they like it. Now 
after using the new beta for some time I think I am converted.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>First let us talk about features. Why did I even bother trying IDEs 
like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> when I actually do not like those bloated pieces of ... 
well, do not get me started. I prefer an editor. It is fast, I do not need to 
create projects and other stuff, do not have to care about anything beside my 
code.</p>

<p>But I tried an IDE. I have seen this fancy features like showing all your 
methods, listing files, jumping from file to file in your project,... They have
a great strategy - they show you all the shiny stuff and hide the fact that it
is still an IDE and just sucks.</p>

<p>So what features should my editor have to compete with an IDE?</p>

<ul>
<li>code completion</li>
<li>easy jumping between files</li>
<li>split view</li>
<li>project view - showing all files in a folder</li>
<li>syntax highlighting for everything I work with</li>
<li>spell checking</li>
<li>git / gist integration</li>
<li>keyboard navigation</li>
</ul>

<p>I still believe that I do not ask for too much. But sadly the only editor that
is actively developed and provides all those features was vim.</p>

<p>And maybe the most important point. I love beautiful things. I work much better
when I am surrounded and use stuff I enjoy using. Guess why I prefer Macs,...</p>

<p>###I am not alone
Looking at all those emerging projects I am not the only one who wants all
those features and cares about stuff like split views. But those projects
are either really new and still in the first beta - and I have seen how dead
a great project can be even when in development. I am looking at you Intype.
- or they are not as actively developed as I prefer it. Textmate, anyone?</p>

<p>So it is possible that those editors will some day be a great alternative and
that I will pay 40â‚¬ for a piece of software I will only use for some months or
a year. Even if the other editors also cost some money. I make my living with
IT. And it is never wasted investing in stuff that makes your life easier,
provides productivity or just helps you getting the job done.</p>

<p>##Workflow
I admit that I use a mouse. Or a touchpad to be honest. I can remember 
key bindings and I also use those but for some tasks I work faster when I just
move my hand away from the keyboard and click on stuff. Having a project
folder on a side of your project, browsing the structure, creating and deleting
folders and files just helps me a lot to work faster. I do not have to switch
to another window or command line I just do one or two clicks. So a project
drawer or filesystem explorer is essential. This does not mean that I do not
want to be able to navigate with my keyboard. More on this topic in a few 
minutes.</p>

<p>Code completion is tricky. Sometimes it saves you a lot of typing. And when it
is even able to show you a documentation about methods you are using you save
a lot of time browsing documentations or trying to figure out why your
arguments will not work. This is not a must have but a nice to have feature.</p>

<p>When you never used an editor that is capable of split views I suggest you
immediately download one. An easy example would be working on a homepage. I
have 2 windows open. A browser to preview my work and an editor with 2 views.
In one view I have my html file and in the other one my css file. Just 
switching the view without the trouble of placing editors side by side helps
a lot keeping all those tags in the right order when working on your css files.</p>

<p>Command-T or from now on Command-P is awesome. You press the keys, start 
typing and just have a list of files that contain what you just type. One
additional keystroke and you have the file open with your cursor at the
method you were looking for. Fast, efficient, a pleasure to work.</p>

<p>Since I switched to <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/Zenbo">Zenbo</a> I use my editor to write blog posts. I am
definitely not the best writer the world has ever seen. My grammar is not
as beautiful as it could be, sometimes I make stupid mistakes and have
to look up words in a dictionary. Spell checking is essential. I am working
on it but I think there will always be some words I have to
look up or need a correction since English is not my native language.</p>

<p>I use git for every project and every piece of code I write. But I always
were a bit skeptical using plugins that integrate it with my editor or IDE.
Currently it looks like the git plugin works fine and is a nice to have
feature. We will see how it works out.</p>

<p>##You only know you want it when you try it
There are some features in my new editor I started using and enjoying in a
blink of an eye. I heard many rumors on Twitter and read some blog posts
how great those are but never thought that I would use them.</p>

<p>One of those features is "distraction free". You basically tell you editor
that you want to see nothing beside him. A dark background and only one
text field to input your text or code. I would not use this feature to write
code but it is a pleasure to use it while writing blog posts. And I will
also give it a chance when I continue working on my first book.</p>

<p>There is an integrated package manager helping you to install plugins.
It is a nice feature to have an integrated search. I had no problem using
the script search on vim.org but if I can have a shortcut I will not 
hesitate using it.</p>

<p>Having snippet and theme support that is actually easy to use and edit
is also really nice. No obscure paths to remember once a year you have to
add or edit something is nice.</p>

<p>##I guess I will,...
For those of you who cannot guess it yet I am talking about <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
I will continue using it for my current project which consists of some 
webdesign and <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> development. I will write some more posts and work on
Zenbo. If Sublime turns out to be what I want I am going to buy it.</p>

<p>But there are some alternatives I also consider if there are some problems.
There is <a href="http://kodapp.com/">Kod</a>, <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/">Espresso</a>, <a href="http://mr-fridge.de/software/tincta/index.php">Tincta</a> and <a href="http://www.vicoapp.com/">Vico</a>.</p>

<p>For my next project that is an iPhone application I will stick to XCode. It
is another workflow and another kind of project. Integrated interface builders
and stuff are also a pleasure. But this will be part of another post. If you
are looking for an editor I only have one suggestion: try them all and use
what fits your workflow and project best - do not trust people like me telling
you why it is great. Experience it first hand.</p>

    <h1>Code Challenge - The Challenge</h1>
    <p>I believe that learning new skills is essential. No matter if it is in your job, your
private life, just for fun without any reason - not learning new tricks means you stand 
still, do not improve, do not get better, nothing. Is there anything that sucks more?
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>There is currently a <a href="http://fredboyle.com/codechallenge/">code challenge</a>. The idea is that you use a new language or
toolkit and create something. Even if it is simple, even if it has no real use, just
for the sake of learning. Great, isn't it?</p>

<p>There are several things I consider. First and most important would be the framework and
language. Since "casually messed around with" is included I have some choices.</p>

<p>I consider <a href="http://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> or <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. Something new, JavaScript based. I could, just
one time, be on the hip site of technology,... Just polishing my Ruby skills would
be boring.</p>

<p>On the other hand something Cocoa based would be another good idea. I will have to write
a lot more code on Objective-C and Cocoa the next few months, so why not using the code
challenge to improve my skills?</p>

<p>No matter what I will use or what I will build I will keep you updated.</p>


    <div class="subbox">
        <p>I would love to talk to you about this post, your ideas or awesome projects.</p>

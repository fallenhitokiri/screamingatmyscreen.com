    <h1>Code Challenge - The Ideas</h1>
    <p>If you read the <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/4/16/code_challenge_-_the_challenge.html">post</a> about "code challenge" you know what I am talking about. If you
did not, you should now. I thought about the challenge and what I could learn and
write. It is possible that I do not really follow the <a href="http://fredboyle.com/codechallenge/">idea</a> but it should be fine.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Even if it is basically about learning something new just for the sake of learning I
refuse to build useless things. So it will not just be a to-do list app. Also I have
some ideas I was thinking about the last few weeks and did not find the opportunity to
fully evaluate existing solutions. Maybe I will also skip the "simple" part.</p>

<p>Let me give you a short idea what I might build in the next few weeks.</p>

<h3>Task Queue</h3>

<p>I need a simple task queue. Existing solutions look full featured with a lot of stuff
and administration overhead I do not need and want. It does not have to be high
performance or scale across thousands of servers, at least not now :&gt;</p>

<p>The implementation could be really simple. Accept socket requests - yes, there is a 
reason why I want to use sockets instead of other protocol - add stuff to a queue and
run the queue based on priority and waiting time.</p>

<p>There program will not be bound to a specific task. Instead it will just run scripts
and pass arguments. This way it will be flexible enough to be used in many different
applications / stacks / setups.</p>

<h3>Multi Server Management</h3>

<p>This could be the bigger challenge. Creating a application that lets you run remote
commands (using ssh) on many servers. But instead of just running them on a set of
servers you could predefine them in lists.</p>

<p>You could create a list for one client or for one task. Imagine you have three clients. 
Each of them has one Django application server, each of them has a PostgreSQL server, 
two of them have a mail server.</p>

<p>Now you create lists for all Django, database and mail servers and one for every client
and add functions describing what commands you want to run.</p>

<p>If you want to update all servers you just run <code>app all update``. If you want to get
statistics how your database servers perform you run</code>app database status```. </p>

<p>Pretty easy and I believe it is possible with existing tools. Not sure if I should go for
this one or the task queue.</p>

<h3>Language</h3>

<p>Implementing both ideas in Python would be easy (read: make the app do what I have in my 
mind) - this means that I already have a basic idea how I will design those applications.</p>

<p>The last time I used Ruby was the time Rails 2 was new, hot stuff. So I basically have to
learn the language again. Should be done in one or two days and after that the hacking
can begin.</p>

<p>On the other hand I was looking for a reason to play around with node.js. I do not really
like JavaScript as a language, but I see the strengths in node.js. It does not matter if I
learn a framework or get used to Ruby - it should take the same amount of time.</p>

<p>It is possible that I will use what I write. In a normal situation I would go for Python,
especially since I do not like mixed language projects or stacks. I know I cannot
prevent it but I can try to use as less languages / frameworks as possible as long as it 
is viable. </p>

<p>Using Ruby would mean using a well established language that proved what it
can do. </p>

<p>Using node.js would mean using a new language that could just blow up and
everything would be gone. But node.js is new, it is interesting and it is currently
showing that it can work.</p>

<p>I am not really sure which I will pick. But as always I will keep you updated.</p>

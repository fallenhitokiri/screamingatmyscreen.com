    <h1>Myth Of Freelancing - You Are Your Own Boss</h1>
    <p>I thought a good start when talking about <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/5/10/time_to_talk_about_business.html">freelancing and running your own business</a>
would be a cold shower for all those who fall for the promises and illusions some people
came up with in the last few years.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>The biggest lie I have ever heard of is that you are your own boss. I cannot think of one 
that is bigger, more spread or caused so many tears when people realized that this is 
basically a nice idea but reality is waiting behind the next corner. With a baseball bat. 
And some friends.</p>

<p>Let us assume you start freelancing or a small business and want it to grow so you can
make a living from it without being caught in slavery, err sorry, employment. You found
someone who is willing to hire you for a project. This is the point where you first 
should have understood something. You were hired for a project. What does being hired 
include? Right, a boss. </p>

<p>##You Are The Expert - You Make The Decisions
We just call him "your client". This sounds like you are in control of everything and he
has to listen to you. You work really hard, you design, you code, you do whatever you
have to do and after some hours, weeks or months you have created something stunning. It
is new, it is shiny it will change everything. "Your client" does not like it and requests
some changes.</p>

<p>Now there are three possible scenarios and depending on your experience, financial
situation, reputation two of them always suck and one sucks less. Actually there is a
fourth one but this is an exception of scenario one.</p>

<p>###Scenario One: You Explain Why You Are Right
First things first. You are never right. You have a opinion. Since you want to make a 
living with your business you should be right. While explaining your point you should
never use the sentence "you are just wrong, I am right" but this is the topic of another 
post.
(Disclaimer: you can use this sentence after some years of experience or you will end up
in scenario two)</p>

<p>This scenario is the one that sucks less. You listen to your client, you try to
understand why he wishes some changes and you start working. Not on what your client
told you but on the solution your client wants. Always tricky but possible with some
experience.</p>

<p>If your client understands why you decided to do things the way you did it is possible
that he does not insist to incorporate his wishes. This is scenario four. Just do not
believe it will ever happen and be happy when it does.</p>

<p>###Scenario Two: You Tell Him He Is Wrong And An Idiot
There are only two reasons to tell this your client. First one: You have enough experience
and you know how to say it nicely that he is not pissed. You are actually in scenario
one. Second: You are an idiot who just lost a client, gained bad reputation because 
your ego was bigger and louder than your brain. You know, this thing in your head always 
telling you to eat some chocolate, drink a coffee and that is also supposed to make 
business decisions.</p>

<p>You stop working on the project. Your client does not want to see you again and you think
you told someone "the truth" about himself. Is it possible that you have forgotten
something? You have to send him an invoice. On a scale from "lol" to "<em>niiiiaaarrrggggg</em>"
(the sound shredders do when they make confetti out of your bill) how likely will your 
client pay you without trouble? What do you think?</p>

<p>Now most of you may complain that this will never happen. Well, I have seen people doing
exactly this. "If you really want this you are just an idiot". It never ended well.</p>

<p>###Scenario Three: You Change Everything
It is your first and only job. You want your client to be happy. You are not sure how to
explain your points. Alluring to just do what he wants, isn't it? You should really try
scenario one. There is a reason he hired you in the first place. You are supposed to
be the expert. You should know why you did something and you should be able to defend 
your work.</p>

<p>If you really do this and the final product is a shame do yourself a favor and try to 
make it look like you never were involved. Your portfolio may look a bit empty but this is
better than having a Geocities page form 1999 in it.</p>

<p>##You Are Your Own Boss
Not listening to your client and doing what you believe is right will likely cause pain.
No money, bad reputation, no follow up jobs... There are better ways to start your new
career. You need exactly the same social skills, maybe even more, and have to behave like 
you would as employee.</p>

<p>Working on five projects means you will have five bosses. Okay, now do not panic. I know
this is a high number but it gets even worse. Sit down and try to stay calm. Maybe even 
more if the company is big enough and every manager that once had a drawing lesson in 
kindergarden believes he is a designer, every janitor that once installed Ubuntu is an 
administrator and the guy who studied math is a software engineer.</p>

<p>One of the most important skills is communicating with other people. You should learn it
pretty fast or you will end in scenario two or three. You do not want to end up in two
or three. Really. </p>

    <h1>Comments and Posts</h1>
    <p class="date">posted on: 3 / 8 / 2012</p>
    <p>There are some general things I want to talk about. The future of 
hopelesscom, what I consider a good solution for comments and how my
posting behavior will change. The last part was not planned for this
post but is a direct reaction, partly in response, to one of my
<a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/2/27/firefox_is_the_new_enemy.html">last posts</a>.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Last thing first. I mentioned that I am working on my language skills.
I know that my posts are not always a pleasure to read and I also know
that I lack some basic copulas. Really working on it. Big promise.</p>

<p>But what I actually want to cover is that I will change two things. First
I will start making shorter posts. Think of them as notes. My longer posts
that cover some sensible topics will be a lot better formulated and read
twice or maybe three times before I really hit publish. Reading my last
post again I started to understand Bjarnis problem or how it came to
the discussion.</p>

<p>I should have separated two things - flaming Firefox and my problems with
CORS. I mixed them up. Reading them I see the point he is trying to make.
I thought the last few sentences covers fact that there is a basic problem if
you use wildcards. Even if I have some problems with CORS and its
implementation half of his comment would have been unnecessary if I
would have been more clear in my initial post or my first comment.</p>

<p>Reading the conversation again, together with my post, I can see how
he and likely other people can come to the conclusion that I just do
not understand CORS or why it was implemented the way it is. I should have
separated those two topics from the beginning and should have added some
more informations why I dislike CORS and how I think the problem should
be fixed instead.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>This is a good moment to leave the old post and move on to comments in
general. I added Disqus, again, because I like comments. Even if they
are not positiv if they are well written and provide value I love
having them in my blog. No matter if I am corrected or if something is
added - or if it just makes clear that I should really work on my writing
skills - if I can learn something it was worth implementing them.</p>

<p>I have read many blogs and I have seen many statements people made. I have
seen all the flamewars and all the possible reactions. What I never got is
why people act pissed or start calling names when someone disagrees and is
even trying to prove his statements. Sometimes I believe people fear to be
wrong or think they lose credibility if they admit that one of their
thoughts or opinions was wrong.</p>

<p>The only thing that bugs me personally is when people get me wrong because
I tend to formulate short sentences and jump between topics. The post I
mentioned is a perfect example. But this is entirely my fault and I am the
only person who can fix this.</p>

<p>But there is one thing I dislike. Disqus. And according to my <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/3/4/is_hacker_news_the_superior_commenting_system_.html">last post</a> I
also believe that it is not necessary to have a comment form in your
blog at all. Even if people want to respond directly they could just
write their own post and send you a trackback or mention at Twitter or
something else.</p>

<p>I am not sure how I will solve this with my next system. Maybe I will
just add a comment form. Maybe I will add something similar to tumblr
and show trackbacks. Maybe I find a better solution.</p>

<h3>Hopelesscom</h3>

<p>There will be some changes. I currently have two blogs. My private blog,
this one, and my business blog currently only in German. Since I moved
back to IT it is likely that I will merge those two blogs under a new
domain. Topics will not change much but I will add some work related
stuff. There will be more informations on this later and it will not
happen the next few weeks.</p>

    <h1>The New iPad And Responsive Web Design</h1>
    <p>It is resolutionary. The new iPad got a display that provides more pixels
than your HDTV. In your pocket, in your hand, everywhere you want it. So 
how can it be possible that a small group of people starts complaining like
four year old Timmy that just realized that his visit in the dental clinic 
will not be the promised Disney Land trip?
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>I am talking about user interface and experience designers specialized in
web development and design (formally known as webdesigners). Luckily most of
us realized that responsive web design a good idea. If you do not know
what I am talking about let me give you a short introduction to the topic
before we talk about what the new iPad means for our work.</p>

<p>##Responsive Web Design
Today we use a wide variety of devices. We visit websites with our
iPads, iPhones, some confused people with their Android things - just
kidding, luv U the same way as the Apple evangelists ;) - and sometimes,
in quiet corners, when no one could possibly notice it, we do the most
uber lame thing mankind can imagine. We use a computer with a nice, big
screen.</p>

<p>Now all those devices have different screen resolutions. People understood
at some point that it is not optional anymore if you can view a website
on a mobile device. Mobile sites emerged. Most of the time known as "the
creepy shit that hides all informations I want with
the subdomain "m" in the URL which I cannot change". I think we all agree
that a witch-hunt would have been an appropriate reaction.</p>

<p>Webdesigners noticed that users were not happy. Some of them even cared
about those bloody leeches that always complain about something and just
do not appreciate the art, all the passion and the newest Photoshop filters
the designer put in his work. They came up with JavaScript solutions. And
it kind of worked and got better.</p>

<p>Fast forward. 2011 / 2012. People understand that HTML and CSS can
actually be used to design and style sites and that JavaScript should be
used to move parts of the page away from the server to the client. Not
necessarily for design purposes or only in small bits.</p>

<p>###Introducing Media Queries
Today it is nearly a standard that you use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">media queries</a> to serve 
different styles. There are many advantages, some shortcomings, but the 
two positive reasons everyone should see:</p>

<ul>
<li>You always have the same URLs, no matter which device you use</li>
<li>Less JavaScript means faster rendering</li>
</ul>

<p>So beside many arguable arguments why media queries are the superior
alternative for responsive web design we should be able to agree on those
two.</p>

<p>You have some options to check your device and based on them decide which
stylesheet is sufficient to provide the best user experience. The most
common and I think the only ones you really need are</p>

<ul>
<li>width</li>
<li>height</li>
<li>orientation</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases <code>device-width</code> and <code>device-height</code> could provide
some value.</p>

<p>###Ignoring Responsive Web Design Is An Option
My last two designs, hopelesscom and <a href="http://www.blazeit.de/">blaze it</a> (sorry, German only)
currently ignore responsive web design. Why? That is really easy to
answer. Both were pushed out because they needed to go live. Responsive
web design is something you put on top of a great design that works on
every device. I made sure they are usable and follow certain standards
but they do not use different stylesheets for different devices nor are
they tuned to the last bit.</p>

<p>But sometimes you have to move stuff like responsive web design to some
future release and just make sure there is something that works. If you
are in this position let me just tell you two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is okay</li>
<li>Remember to add it later and do not screw it up</li>
</ul>

<p>Just because responsive web design is the new black does not mean that you
have to wear it. Do not screw up is another thing. Even if you ignore
media queries, relative font sizes and everything else. Make sure your
design works on <em>every</em> device with <em>any</em> resolution. If this is the
case you can ignore everything else. You accomplished enough for a quick
"it needs to be released. NOW!" situation. Just add it sometime later.
Really, add it. I mean it.</p>

<p>##Why Does The New iPad Change The Game?
Let us assume you want your design to be responsive. You start looking
at devices and their resolutions. In the end it always comes down to the
question "is my user able to use my page without trouble". This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>no zooming to get the idea what content he is viewing</li>
<li>no zooming to hit the right menu button</li>
<li>no scrolling to notice the current location</li>
</ul>

<p>Most designers used to create different stylesheets to cover the common
resolutions. 480, 1024 and above. Some hard-core stylesheet fans created
up to six to eight versions. God save them when they have to add something
new and where stupid enough to ignore <a href="http://lesscss.org/">less</a> or <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>. Even with
those two it would be a pain in the ass. In a perfect scenario you need
two stylesheets. Yes, I said two.</p>

<ul>
<li>desktop</li>
<li>mobile</li>
</ul>

<p>Use relative values instead of fixed ones and you are nearly set. Of course
it is a bit harder, takes some time to develop but most of the time this
will scale for nearly every desktop user. It would even scale for mobile
users but they deserve their own stylesheet. Why?</p>

<p>Bandwidth. While a desktop user can easily load 5MB fonts, 3MB JavaScript
and 10MB images - yes I am a bit exaggerating but you get the point - a
mobile user is most of the time on a slow 3G connection. LTE is currently
no standard and sometimes they even have to use Edge or GPRS. Minimize
page loading time. Optimize images and JavaScript for size and use less
fonts. Rendering on mobile devices is fast,
downloading stuff is not. This alone is the best reason for a mobile
stylesheet.</p>

<p>Now thanks to the new iPad the game changed and we have new rules.</p>

<p>###Can I Haz More Than FullHD?!
Look at the numbers. We are talking about 2048x1536 pixels. Stunning 264
dpi. Show me more screens with this resolution and dpi numbers. Now most
designers use media queries and just add stuff and higher resolution
images. Skip three paragraphs back. Bandwidth. Proving a stylesheet with
images that fits the new iPad would make the site nearly unusable on
mobile networks.</p>

<p>Now the rules changed. You cannot make your assumptions based on the 
screens width and height anymore. If you do so your users will not really
like you anymore. But what options do we have?</p>

<ul>
<li>Create layouts that just work and add or change elements based on the resolution</li>
<li>Create three stylesheets</li>
</ul>

<p>I would prefer option one. More stylesheets always mean more work when
you have to change or maintain your site. Adding complexity is not a
good idea. If you are a web designer I can see why you use eight or now
nine stylesheets. But sadly impressing people has nothing to do with 
effective and efficient client work.</p>

<p>I will write a follow up post, suggesting how to use media queries and how to
optimize your site for screen and mobile usage. Just some basic rules
some web-user-interface-experience-designer-engineers-whatever will look
down on and tell me that there is way more room for creating different
styles, squeezing in some extra pixels and whatever. In my opinion there
are only two things that really matter: Stunning designs that work on
every device and are a pleasure to use and ease of maintenance. And you
can accomplish this with one or two stylesheets.</p>

<p>###How To React To The New iPad?
I suggest we just use something that is already available, but most of us
ignored, because we just did not need it. Let us praise media queries that
check the <code>resolution</code>. If it is 264dpi we can be kind of sure for now
that we are displaying stuff on a new iPad. Even if you ignore zooming and
scrolling, add some images that are compressed and remove some fonts.</p>

<p>I fear that this will only be a short-time solution and that we will have
to come up with something better. Maybe we have to go back to JavaScript.
The only displays I know that have such a high dpi count are retina 
displays and the only one running a resolution that falls in the desktop
segment is the new iPad. But I am sure we will see more screens with
a high dpi count in the future and at this moment we need a different 
solution.</p>

<p>###User Want Sharp Stuff
Till now we discussed a perfect bubble where everything is designed to make
our life as comfortable as possible. Our own little world with pink
unicorns vomiting rainbows. But there is one point I did not talk about.</p>

<p>Scaling down images and removing fonts is not without risk. People buy
iPads to surf at home without the need for a laptop or desktop. They
buy it to experience the full web. Removing fonts and delivering low
quality images would be an offense. They do not care about mobile users, 
they have wifi and they do not care about bandwidth.</p>

<p>The biggest question we have to answer is "do our users use the iPad
with 3G / LTE or on wifi?". I often use 3G, roughly
between 15 and 30 hours a month. From my point of view this is
a pretty high number and I am sure I would be not as amused as I always am
when I have to wait for a page to download 20MB. Besides the fact that 
connections, especially in trains, are not always stable and pages that
take some time and bandwidth are not always viewable.</p>

<p>My new iPad will arrive in (hopefully) two weeks and from this point I
will be using it on 3G, too. And more people will do this. Looking
at some numbers I believe that we are really a minority. And as long as it
is not possible to check user bandwidth before deciding which stylesheet to
deliver to mobile users, we should just shut up and be happy about high
quality content when we are hardcore couching.</p>

<p>You can only lose this game. Either you punish high resolution wifi users
or you screw mobile users up. According to numbers I tend to screw up
mobile users till there is a better and especially viable solution. Our
best option are high resolution images with a degree of compression that
is okay but also allows a small file size.</p>

<p>The new iPad definitely changes the way we have to think about our
designs but it should currently not influence our way we do it. At least
not until we can react to bandwidth. All options I know (like parsing 
request headers) are not viable or as accurate as they have to be to work
reliable.</p>

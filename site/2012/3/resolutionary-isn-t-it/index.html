    <h1>Resolutionary, isn't it?</h1>
    <p>It is the time of the year when men start to calculate their budget, women
looking forward to their soon new toy, people hammering [F5] and newsfeeds
full of narrations of the last keynote. It is iPad time.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Before the keynote I was sure that if I would upgrade the iPad it would
be more a "want to have" situation. I am still happy with my iPad 1.
When the iPad 2 was announced I refused to upgrade because there was
nothing that really would have improved my situation. At least I thought
that.</p>

<p>I use the iPad every day. In the morning with my cup of coffee in my hand
I sit on the couch and start reading news and checking my social media
accounts. Some time around noon I repeat this procedure. Every time I
travel to my spouse I sit in the train reading a book, checking news,
writing or watching a movie. I love the iPad and I refuse to live without
one.</p>

<p>What I did not get until I got my <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/2/9/first_day_with_an_iphone_4s.html">iPhone 4s</a> is that the display can
be a huge difference. Especially while reading. The display would be one
of two reasons why I consider the iPad 3. If it is really more comfortable
to read on the device it is worth the money.</p>

<p>The other reason would be the fact that some of my current projects include
an iOS application. The iPhone 4s was a split between necessary and that
I have to develop an app that needs a lot of CPU power and is primary
deployed on iPhone 4ses. (Am I the only one who does not like the look of
"4ses"?) Having the current CPU model at hand to test stuff seems to be 
a good idea.</p>

<p>I do not need a camera in my iPad. I do not need everything else. Well
a longer lasting battery is always nice even if the iPad 1 fits my needs.
The only two reasons are the display and the fact that I work on iOS
projects.</p>

<p>But is there really nothing I would want to change about the iPad 1?
Of course there is. Beside the original Twitter client that just sucks
Safari started crashing. Really often. 6 to 10 times a day. And this just
sucks. I do not lose my session but it is annoying. Most of the time 
when I visit sites that run some intensive JavaScript stuff like the
Apple Store or <a href="http://techcrunch.com/">Tech Crunch</a>. I believe it it somehow JS related.
Could also depend on the size of the site.
I did not test it yet. If this would be the case and it would be caused
by some resource shortage the new hardware would be worth it.</p>

<p>I know that this <a href="http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20120305">comic</a> describes some, or most, Apple fans and 
sometimes I have to admit that it is tempting but since I tend to
think about money before I spend it am am always a bit reluctant.
Currently I believe that I will get one, even if I do not care if I get
it on 16th or 2 weeks later.</p>

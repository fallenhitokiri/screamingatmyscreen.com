I am currently working on some projects and two them are kind of private or semi-private. 
My private and my business domain will receive a redesign and a Django based
backend. I thought about writing a modular content management system and provide it
as hosted option for some clients. And while working on it I noticed something that is
in my opinion wrong with most existing solutions.

I came across an [interesting article][1] indicating that RSS has some major problems. 
Do not get confused by the title, it is a bit exaggerating and, as most headlines,
just tries to catch as many readers as possible. And "war" against something IT related,
most people heard of but have no idea what it is doing, is always a good start.

I believe that learning new skills is essential. No matter if it is in your job, your

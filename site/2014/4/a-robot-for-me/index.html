    <h1>A robot for... me?!</h1>
    <p>With colleagues it is sometimes as with babies. Everyone thinks he got the best, cutest and most fun to be around. But honestly: if this would be a game, I would win ;) . On Valentines Day my colleagues surprised me with a self-made telepresence device.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Just read the <a href="http://blog.printf.net/articles/2014/03/18/a-robot-for-timo/">blog post</a> Chris wrote and the <a href="http://hackaday.com/2014/03/27/telepresence-robot-proves-its-a-small-world-after-all/">short article</a> on Hack A Day. It should give you a good idea how it works and what the project looks like. Something I personally like is that <a href="https://github.com/flightcar/broadway-nodejs">two</a> <a href="https://github.com/flightcar/broadway-ios-remote">parts</a> of the project "borrowed" from things we built for a different purpose. </p>

<p>There are some things I will talk about in a later post. I really have some catching up to do with all the posts, @sternenkind moving in just took way longer than expected, which is also the reason why I did not have time to work on two features I want to see:</p>

<ul>
<li>a desktop client to control the robot</li>
<li>fixed position movement - move from one pre defined position to another one</li>
</ul>

<p>There were some hilarious scenes, people stop by for a quick chat and if you can just discuss a problem or an idea without first initiating a video call, which is, surprisingly, still a hassle in 2014. It can be really helpful.</p>

<p>If you want to stay up to date you can follow <a href="https://github.com/flightcar">FlightCar on GitHub</a> or the individual repositories prefixed with <code>broadway-</code>. The current implementation works great and is a lot of fun to use. If you have someone remote and are looking for a a way to still have them in your office I would suggest you give it a try.</p>

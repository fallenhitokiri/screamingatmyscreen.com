    <h1>Happy New Year - Welcome 2014</h1>
    <p>I hope you all had an awesome start in this new year and that you have the chance to do something awesome and exciting. As regular readers know I think of "new year resolutions" as something worthless. If you want to change something you should start now, not on an arbitrary date.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>But not having any life changing plans for 2014 does not mean that I have not planned some projects for this year. I want to give you a quick idea what you can expect to see the next 12 months.</p>

<ul>
<li>a new version of drupan will be released making the generation of blog unrelated sites a lot easier</li>
<li>an entirely new blogging platform - if you read my <a href="http://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/2013/8/the-joy-and-pain-of-using-a-static-site-generator-for-private-and-client-work/">past CMS rant</a> you could figure out what it will look like, but I will also blog about it the next few days</li>
<li>I will publish my first book</li>
<li>currently it looks like a side project could turn into a service I open for everyone, maybe release it on GitHub, not aiming for profit</li>
</ul>

<p>Enough ranting for the first day of the year. Stay as awesome as you are and do something extraordinary!</p>


    <div class="subbox">
        <p>I would love to talk to you about this post, your ideas or awesome projects.</p> 
        <p>I am <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fallenhitokiri/">@fallenhitokiri</a> on Twitter and 
            <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/">GitHub</a> or 
            you can send me a <a href="mailto:timo (at) screamingatmyscreen (dot) com">mail</a>.</p>

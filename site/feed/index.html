                <title>Selling Your Service Or Product - The Basics</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>Last week I was talking to 14 boys and girls about IT. Their school offered an orientation day and I was invited as a speaker. One of them was especially interested in selling products. Now this is something I wanted to talk about for a long time on my blog. Maybe you remember the <a href="/2012/5/time-to-talk-about-business/">"talk about business"</a> series?
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>I used to make a big part of my living as consultant for eight years. I had the opportunity to learn from great, international coaches and at the same time practice what I learned. The basic idea of selling and consulting is always the same - no matter if we talk about software or a vacuum cleaner. And still so many people (even big companies) do it horrible wrong. Of course really big companies get away with it most of the time, but this is due to other factors. For us it is interesting to know how we should market and sell our product or the service we just built.</p>

<h2>Marketing And Selling Is Important</h2>

<p>I know enough people who think sales persons or marketing departments are utterly useless. They believe a great product is enough. Most of the time those people are the ones who build fantastic applications, hardware or services. Sadly those are the same people who do not understand that not everyone is like them. If they see something new and think it could be interesting they give it a try. Other people just don't.</p>

<p>Customers do not want stunning websites with a lot of descriptions what a great product can do. They do not even care about the built-in cheese grater. They want someone who listens to their problems and tells them how they can fix it with this special product. Some tech-savvy, misanthropic assholes will be offended and disagree, but "humans need humans" was, is and will be a universal truth.</p>

<p>No matter how good your product is, if no one knows about it, if your competitors send someone with a demonstration device to potential customers or if people do not fully understand your product no one will buy it. Not even if it is the best one available.</p>

<h2>Know Your Product</h2>

<p>If you do not know the product you cannot sell it. It is really that easy. If your potential customers asks questions and you have no idea or have to call someone or read your own flyer - then you have a problem. There is nothing that makes selling harder to impossible than being caught off guard on basic questions.</p>

<p>This does not mean you have to know every little detail. You should know if your web service is able to send newsletters to customers. You do not have to know how to partition databases to scale it.</p>

<p>There is a difference between knowing a product and knowing every detail. On the one hand, you should know as much as possible - but on the other hand it's no shame to call your office and ask a developer if and how this special scenario could be realized. </p>

<p>If a client has some special needs and you talk to one of your developers before promising that it will work you have another advantage: Your client can be sure that you are not just some sales person promising pink ponies to land a deal. At least this is what clients believe. Developers know the software they build and what it is capable of, right?</p>

<h2>Know Your Contenders</h2>

<p>If you are selling a software as a service, for example, then you have to know your competitors. What if a potential client already is a customer of someone else? What if they ask you about the differences to evaluate which solutions fits their needs? You have to be able to answer those questions. But there is one thing you should not do:</p>

<p>Never start telling your potential customers why other products suck. Never ever.</p>

<p>I cannot stress this enough. If you are not explicitly asked about the differences, you talk about the strengths and advantages of your product. And if you are asked you talk about the strengths and advantages of your product.</p>

<p>I know some people will call me fanboy for this one but the example just works. Imagine an elderly women who wants to buy a smartphone. You tell her that the new Samsung Galaxy 7 has a 90" screen, 500 cores and 45 petabyte memory. 
I just give her an iPhone, tell her to type the number of her daughter, hit FaceTime and she can see her grandchild.</p>

<p>You can tell her that the iPhone has far inferior hardware. 
I can tell her how easy it is to use and that she can always call her daughter and see her grandchildren rise. I do not have to explain to her why the specs don't matter, manufacturing quality or anything else.</p>

<p>Some of you might now argue that this example is wrong because the Galaxy and "what if"â€¦ you get the point. This example sucks, but it's the best one I can come up with at the moment. Let us continue.</p>

<h3>If You Have A Bad Product</h3>

<p>You should be aware of the weaknesses of your product.
There is, most of the time, not only one product for a certain task and most of the time you have different trade offs if you choose one of the products over another.</p>

<p>But what do you do when your product is just bad? Cheap components, known problems, not matching any use case?</p>

<p>Stop selling it. If you sell crap people will notice at a certain point. Get another job.</p>

<p>There was a new client I visited for the first time. Coffee was prepared and it was just a matter of "What do you need?", "What makes sense for you?", questions and statements. 
How did I get this client? Another client recommended me. </p>

<p>The new client knew that I do not make promises I cannot fulfill and that I also admit if there are weaknesses in one of the products or scenarios where it is problematic. And still, I did not need to convince him that those products are still worth buying. I showed him how he can solve the problem he has with the product I have. Nothing more. </p>

<p>This appointment only went so smooth because a previous client recommended me. Not my product. Customers and clients sometimes care more about the people who sell something than about the actual product. This also means that you do not sell them something they do not need - or your reputation will suffer.</p>

<h2>Service Always Starts After You Sold</h2>

<p>Take care of problems. Call or email your new customer personally. Do not let your secretary handle everything. Know their birthday. Maybe, if it came up in a conversation, the birthdays of wife, husband or kids. Remember the dates and gratulate them personally.</p>

<p>This is one of the differences between selling something and building a client relationship. Be nice, keep your promises and from time to time just let him know you remember him without directly calling to sell something.</p>

<p>Maybe you have candy or other merchandise stuff with your company brand. Throw it away. Kids do not want company branded chocolate. They want an ordinary chocolate bar they know and like. Most of the time this branded stuff tastes awful, and no one needs yet another ruler.</p>

<p>Know what your client likes. Wine, Whisky or chocolate - get something that tastes good without your brand. These are birthday or Christmas gifts people remember. Especially if you have a present for their kids or even a snack for their pets. </p>

<h2>In A Nutshell</h2>

<p>These are only rough, not completely elaborated points about best practices. They can be a bit different depending on your country, on your product, your personality and your client.</p>

<p>But there are some things I consider to be a universal truth:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be honest</li>
<li>You have to sell to make money</li>
<li>Talk about strengths of your product</li>
<li>Treat other people with respect</li>
<li>Keep promises</li>
<li>Only sell if it makes sense for the customer</li>
<li>Don't sell garbage</li>
<li>Service starts after the deal is closed</li>
<li>A good reputation is essential</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot more to say about selling and marketing and I will likely take the time and talk about every point in its own post.</p>

<p>But if you now think: "Doh, of course! This is simple. No need to talk about this stuff!", ask yourself if every sales and support person you encountered in your life followed this easy and simple principles we should not even have to mention.</p>

<p>But now that the basics are clear we can talk about some more serious and in depth about those points.</p>

                <title>Django Beginner Series - Introduction</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>Some Twitter followers could already know that I am working on a book. Just not what it is about. Big announcement: It will be about web application development using Django. It is supposed to be an easy entry in the world of Django and tries to cover as much as possible in a simple way to get started with the framework.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>If you do not care why I am doing this skip to "ideas and how this blog is involved" to get an idea what tutorials I will post in the course of the next weeks.</p>

<p>Django is the best documented project I know. You can find nearly anything in the documentation and if you are not comfortable browsing it you can just read the code with comments. But there is something Django lacks. I know that not everyone agrees with me on this. But I also know how many people asked me basic things they could not figure out just from reading the tutorial. Django needs some basic introduction material.</p>

<p>I do not think it would be wise to rewrite the whole documentation. If I want to know something about a model field, how a battery works or just see if there is something I am missing about a problem the documentation is great. But it does not walk you through the process of creating a basic application that actually works. At least not good enough as it looks to me.</p>

<p>I am aware that there are great resources and that there is even a "community driven book". But this brings me to another point. There are nearly no books written in German about Django. I think I have seen one. Sometimes it only has a little paragraph, maybe a chapter in a book about Python but nothing serious. Other books, written in English, are just so outdated it hurts.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with Django and my company realizes projects based on it on a regular basis. I would love to see more people using Django and I think this could be a way to give something back to the project. A little thank you, spreading the word and showing the great possibilities and reasons why more people should consider using Django.</p>

<h2>Ideas And How This Blog Is Involved</h2>

<p>I know that I am not in the position to provide a solid English translation of the book directly after it is finished. Not without some help. And I am also not sure when I will find the time to translate it. So I had another idea.</p>

<p>In the book I will use examples that are supposed to help my readers with real world problems. We will build</p>

<ul>
<li>a basic content management system</li>
<li>some kind of wiki</li>
<li>a tumblelog</li>
<li>something that will remind you of Twitter</li>
</ul>

<p>Beside the basic idea how to start such projects I can introduce management commands, migrations, templating, user accounts and profiles, project layout and structure and other stuff without boring everyone to death.</p>

<p>To reach more people I will link the examples in this blog and add tutorials how everything is put together.</p>

<p>The four "big projects" are currently only ideas. I am still looking for some input what I should include and what I should leave out of the tutorials. The goal is pretty simple: "Introduce enough features so everyone has a basic understanding how Django works and hopefully will be able to realize any project with the help of the documentation". I refuse to copy big parts of the docs, this would make the whole project pointless.</p>

<p>If you have any ideas, wishes or comments send me a <a href="mailto:timo@screamingatmyscreen.com">mail</a>, comment on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4749368">Hacker News</a> or send me a <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fallenhitokiri">tweet</a>.</p>

                <title>The iPad Mini Is Not For You</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>Yesterday Apple introduced the iPad mini. As always I had two different types of people in my Twitter timeline. Those who tried to order it before the keynote was finished and those who explained why the iPad mini is a big disappointment. I believe it is great, just not for "us".
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>With "us" I mean me and likely everyone who is reading this blog. There are some exceptions, of course. Those who want a small eBook reader without sacrifycing the features of an iPad will be happy with the iPad mini. Everyone else will stick to the iPad as we know it.</p>

<h2>iPad mini As eBook Reader</h2>

<p>I recently started using my iPad to read a book. First I was not sure if I like a display in front of me or if it will be comfortable enough. I've been reading books for some years now and I am just used to those paper things. It works. Always. They are never low on battery, never required a charger, are instantly on, I do not have to update them and can always read them, not only in areas where books are "allowed". But I thought I should give eBooks a fair chance.</p>

<p>Three days later I am convinced that I will stick to it. It is easier to handle, I do not have to find a light source (I read in my bed most of the time) and, even if it is a lot of fun, I do not have to visit a book store if I do not want to. I also trust Apple to not pull an <a href="http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/">Amazon</a> on me.</p>

<p>But since I am not one of the biggest book lovers on earth I talked to my spouse. She basically owns more books than every library I know and still believes it is not enough. Books are her shoes. She explained to me that the iPad is nice but a bit too big for her liking to effectively replace a book. So the iPad mini would be ideal for her to replace books - only talking about size and weight, not the fact that some part of her is a little book snob and likely will never joining the digital gang.</p>

<h3>No Retina Display</h3>

<p>I do not see the lack of a retina display as bad. I still use my iPad first generation to read books. Of course a retina display is nice. But as long as you do not directly compare both displays to each other, the first generation iPad is still fairly good for reading.</p>

<p>Now the iPad mini has the same resolution on a smaller display. PPI are nearer to the retina display, even if still not there. We have to wait till someone actually uses the device to know if it is "near enough".</p>

<h2>Features, Specs and Quality</h2>

<p>I had a short <a href="https://twitter.com/fallenhitokiri/status/260836338230775808">tweet-exchange</a> with Jeff Croft. He is not really a big fan of the specs. There is no point in arguing, he is right.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-in-reply-to="260831959926841344"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/fallenhitokiri">fallenhitokiri</a> Totally agree. More than happy to pay a premium for high-end build quality. A 65% premium AND a shitty screen, tho? Too much</p>&mdash; Jeff Croft (@jcroft) <a href="https://twitter.com/jcroft/status/260832245034647552" data-datetime="2012-10-23T19:57:07+00:00">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This little piece of tech is not bleeding edge. It does not have a retina display. It is not the fastest tablet the world has ever seen. It is small. It is a full featured iOS device. It is cheap compared to its "big brothers". It is a device you buy if you want iOS and not pay half a monthly income.</p>

<p>But the big difference to other tablets or eBook readers is iOS. I cannot stress this enough. Full featured iOS device for ~$300. If you really only want to read eBooks you have to decide if you want <a href="http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/">Amazon DRM</a> or Apple. Hard decision when you can go for Apple and get both services and some more iOS magic.</p>

<p>What is not questionable is the iPad mini vs all other Android devices around $200-$300. I want quality. Not plastic. It is that easy. Most cheap tablets I hold in my hands so far wereâ€¦ cheap. You notice it when you hold them, when you touch them and when you type on them.</p>

<h2>Target Group</h2>

<p>Even if the specs are not premium the overall quality still is. And this is another big selling point. You get Apple quality and software for a low entry price.</p>

<p>Most people I have seen being disappointed by the iPad mini are tech-savvy. They know what a CPU is, they know what a retina display is and they do more than just reading a mail and a book or sometimes visiting a homepage to see if their favorite sports team won.</p>

<p>You can consider the iPad mini an gateway drug. You want iOS and Apple quality but you are still not sold on it. Now you do not discuss if you can spare &gt; $500. You think about $300. It makes a big difference.</p>

<p>If you take away all the tech stuff we all love (and just look at use cases and money you have to spend to get a device which is capable of fulfilling your needs) the iPad mini magically appears to make sense.</p>

<h2>I Am Not Disappointed</h2>

<p>But I still will not buy it. I do not have to optimize applications for another display resolution, I am comfortable with a bigger screen and I want retina. It is easy. The big one.</p>

<p>My parents on the other hand just read some mails, sometimes visit a sports site, look at a power point presentation or FaceTime with me. Do they need all those fancy features, specs and power? No.</p>

<p>Maybe Kenneth Reitz is right, at least it could be possible and I see a chance that this will happen.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>If the iPad Mini launches today at $300 or less, I fully expect it to replace desktop computers for 90% of my family members.</p>&mdash; Kenneth Reitz (@kennethreitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/kennethreitz/status/260734427531984896" data-datetime="2012-10-23T13:28:26+00:00">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Let us be honest. Most people do not need a computer. They need an email client and a browser on a device they cannot break or mess up. Overall quality and usability are more important than specs.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The iPad mini is great for people who do not care about specs, want a tool for a limited range of certain tasks and are not willing to pay a lot of money to get a device for trivial things which has features they do not care about.
Everyone else will stick to its bigger brothers.</p>

                <title>Zenbo, Zenbo As A Service And Pricing</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>After a week of working on Zenbo (and desperately searching for a new name, as this one is already protected by someone else) there are some news I want to share with you. Sadly not everything worked as expected and there were some private issues I had to take care of. But the good news are that I am on a good track for a release. Let me give you an overview what happened and what you can expect.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>First of all there were some major commits and pushes to the <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/Zenbo">GitHub repository</a>. Some changes that look small but make a lot of sense if you take the greater picture into consideration.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Each plugin will now ship with a default configuration. This means that you can, if you are happy with the defaults, run with a configuration file that only consists of three lines. A major step for people starting to use Zenbo.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are some things left to do. There will be a way to run Zenbo with defaults and command line arguments. This is needed for the hosting.</p>

<h3>Plugins</h3>

<p>There are no categories for plugins anymore. There is just a plugin with a <code>run</code> method in a class called <code>Feature</code>. The order in which plugins are executed is determinate by the order in which they are listed in the configuration file.</p>

<p>This makes it easy to add a base class for common features which will happen at one point. This way configuration handling will be provided by Zenbo and not be the job of every plugin and plugin author.</p>

<h3>Usability</h3>

<p>Today I started working on a way to setup a new site with <code>zenbo --init</code>. It is still a bit rough around the edges but I think it will be done tomorrow. The goal is making it easy for people without prior Zenbo experience getting a site up and running with one command. Deployment excluded.</p>

<h2>Zenbo As A Service</h2>

<p>I talked about <a href="http://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/2012/9/23/updates_on_zenbo_and_zenbo-hosted.html">zenbo-hosted</a>. Some people asked why we need another hosting and blogging service. The answer is pretty easy. I want it for my own and my companies projects.</p>

<p>Most of the time there is no reason for full featured content management systems and there is also no reason to waste money of clients for server resources and hosting they do not really need. With Zenbo as a service there is a way to edit sites in the browser and still benefit from the advantages of a static generated site.</p>

<p>Everyone who prefers a fast and easy to use hosting service, who wants to edit files locally and test a site before it goes live, designers who love the freedom doing what they want, not being tied to the annoyances and limitations of a CMS, everyone who loves git and vim will hopefully enjoy it.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>

<p>There will be a longer post how everything will work but a quick overview.</p>

<p>The backend will be hosted on a dedicated server. Adding content, no matter if you push with git or add it through the web interface will cause a commit in the git repository which will trigger a hook that starts generating your site.</p>

<p>Between the generation and the repository will be Celery which will make sure the same site is not generated multiple times parallel, that there are not 500 processes fighting over system resources and finally notify the front end if everything is fine or if problems occurred. My last tests indicate that generating 100 sites parallel should be fine on a small box. And thanks to some revised design decisions it will be easy to just add more or bigger boxes.</p>

<p>The final site will be hosted on S3. This will add a hughe performance boost over one or two server and cut down costs. If a customer still wants more performance I will offer a CloudFront add-on. This is, at least for my current knowledge, the fastest possible site you can have. No backend wasting time on generating content, servers near every customer visiting your site, in one word: performance.</p>

<h3>Pricing</h3>

<p>Now that I had some time evaluating my options I decided what the pricing will look like. Thanks to an Amazon Web Services event in Leipzig I had the opportunity to talk to some people and answer some open questions.</p>

<p>Zenbo-hosted will be free for everything which is non-commercial. There will be some strings attached to it. Those are still a topic that has to be discussed.</p>

<ul>
<li>private sites will always be free</li>
<li>no advertisement, or anything else</li>
<li>no file hosting</li>
<li>non-profit organizations have special rules</li>
</ul>

<h3>File Hosting</h3>

<p>This is just a matter of costs. I want to keep the service free with no strings attached for private usage. Putting up a 2MB PDF with your rÃ©sumÃ© is fine. Images and image galleries are fine. Uploading the last season of Buffy you just ripped for your friends is not cool. Not only because of the costs but also because of all the DMCA stuff I would have to answer.</p>

<h3>Non-profit Organizations</h3>

<p>Most of the time they cause some decent traffic and have some money at their hands for organizational costs. The only thing that changes is that they are halt to put "powered by Zenbo-hosted" in the footer of the site.</p>

<p>If a non-profit organization decides to use Zenbo I hope they will get in touch with me. I would be happy to support them and provide add-on packages as a donation.</p>

<h3>Companies</h3>

<p>Basically pretty easy. $5 / month as basic plan and you pay what you use. That is it. Without any add-ons this is everything you have to pay for.</p>

<h3>Add-Ons</h3>

<p>There will be several add-on packages you can order which will be a paid service. I am not sure if they will be all available at the beginning but they should appear in the course of this year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Post by mail</li>
<li>Hosting files</li>
<li>Dedicated backend</li>
<li>Mail service</li>
<li>API to submit any form you put on your site</li>
<li>Custom plugins</li>
<li>Domain service / DNS</li>
<li>AWS CloudFront support</li>
</ul>

<p>Beside the file hosting all features will be around $1 to $3 a month. I think this is reasonable and affordable.</p>

<h2>Why Am I Building This?</h2>

<p>Because I believe people will enjoy using it. Because I want to offer a different approach to classic hosting services. Because it is fun. Because it will be beneficial for my company. Because I hope some people who did amazing stuff that helped me do my job and run my business will notice it and use it - my way of saying "thank you".</p>

<p>There are many reasons. For me, the most important ones are fun, saying "thank you" and providing a solid base for future projects I and my company will be working on.</p>

                <title>Updates On Zenbo And Zenbo-hosted</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>After a week of doing nearly nothing, thanks to a really bad cold, I managed to get some testing and coding done. I thought I give you some updates how your favorite project is doing and how soon you will see the release of the last blogging platform you will ever need.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>This is one of the names and slogans that were suggested for Zenbo-hosted. While I liked this one, even if it maybe not 100% accurate, here are some more.</p>

<ul>
<li>yet another blogging platform</li>
<li>static blogging</li>
<li>scaled blogging</li>
<li>blogging with fun again</li>
</ul>

<p>I also thought about just using Zenbo. Name the service after the core software that is used. I had far worser ideas, believe me. The final decisions will be made in some weeks, so I am not really stressed making my mind up.</p>

<h3>Zenbo</h3>

<p>Today Zenbo learned what tags are and how they work. The documentation is not really finished but I did not find any bugs in the implementation so I just pushed it to the <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/Zenbo">repository on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>One of the main things I have to fix before the first release will be the way Zenbo reads and uses the configuration. A plugin should ship with sane defaults. Currently you have to add all configuration options to <code>config.yaml</code> which is not really comfortable, fast or clean.</p>

<p>Also it will be a lot easier to integrate Zenbo in zenbo-hosted if the configuration is internally represented as an object.</p>

<p>I think we will see the last beta version next week. After adding some more tests and finished the crawler everything should be ready for 1.0.0, except the documentation which is a different topic.</p>

<h3>Zenbo-hosted</h3>

<p>I have a basic implementation of the backend. Currently only working if the backend and web server are running on the same server. Separating the backend from the fronted needs some time. I am not sure if I will just use <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.4.3/index.html">Fabric</a> or integrate SSH to run commands on a remote system. Fabric seems to be the better way.</p>

<p>Adding multiple fronted servers on the other hand is already integrated. To be honest I am just to lazy to change the database scheme, even if it is quiet easy thanks to <a href="http://south.aeracode.org">South</a>.</p>

<p>I am also not happy with the way I create git repositories. I subprocess too much for my taste but finding a python git library that does not suck is not as easy as it sounds.</p>

<p>Pricing is also nearly set. Free for non-commercial use. I am not sure how to price companies but I thought about something like 10k requests / $x. Not sure what x needs to be to make this service sustainable.</p>

<p>I have some work to do the next two weeks but I think I will be able to release an early beta in October.</p>

                <title>Taking Zenbo To The Next Level - Zenbo-hosted</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>The beta is running pretty great and I am making progress towards a <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/8/14/the_road_to_zenbo_1_0.html">1.0 release candidate</a>. While working on <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/9/9/my_stack_is_bigger_than_yours_-_ranting_about_web_applications_and_scalability.html">a project</a> for my company to enable forms and other dynamic features in Zenbo I thought about something totally different. Providing a hosted service for Zenbo. How exactly would this look like?
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Before I start I want to mention that I do not plan becoming the next Tumblr or Posterous and that I also have no intention to compete with Wordpress over the last 14 year old who just wants to post about his new puppy. Neither are the plans really polished or in a final "I have a big announcement" state. This is more a public brainstorming to see if I get some reactions or people who would be interested and give it a try.</p>

<p>Zenbo-hosted, internal development name which is still open for discussion, would target a certain group of people. A group I did not believe would be interested in such a service till I read a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt">Gary Bernhardt</a> (which I cannot find anymore. He tweets too much) and did some research to find out that more people would love to see such a service.</p>

<p>I thought that developers and tech-savvy people are fine running their own blog and server. After looking at some posts there is one common sentence: "I would love a service that lets me do $this and $that." Turns out some people just want a great platform and do not care about something trivial like blogging software and running <code>apt-get update; apt-get upgrade</code> from time to time.</p>

<p>Now what would Zenbo-hosted look like?</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Admin interface to quickly post from a browser</li>
<li>Service to post by mail</li>
<li>Still everything in a git repository</li>
<li>Static generated site</li>
<li>Backend service so you can submit forms, save them and receive them as mail</li>
<li>Everything in git</li>
</ul>

<p>So you would basically be free how to submit content. Write it in vim and push your repository, write in your browser like you would do it with every other content management system or send posts via mail. The backend service is in my opinion not as necessary for most people who would be interested in a git based hosted blog platform but a nice to have. Okay, I also have a nearly finished implementation, so why not? :)</p>

<h3>Scaling</h3>

<p>I do not believe I will attract high traffic sites that make it to the frontpage of HN once a week. But since developers have a tendency to write great posts it could be possible that there are unknown amounts of visits. I currently think and hope that this would not become a problem.</p>

<p>Hopelesscom currently runs on the <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/hosting/produkte_vserver/vq7">smallest vServer Hetzner</a> offers with some stuff consuming huge amounts of the already small amount of RAM. Just a default, unoptimized lighttpd without any caching. My <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/9/9/my_stack_is_bigger_than_yours_-_ranting_about_web_applications_and_scalability.html">last post</a> had 40-70k requests/hour. The server did not show any significant load. It did not even go above 1.00.  </p>

<p>Scaling is the thing that would likely give me the most headaches. If people really trust me to host their blogs they use to publish great stuff I want those blogs to be available all the time. No matter how. Thanks to the nature of static sites the last possible solution, namely Amazon S3, should be the one that should always work if everything else would fail me.</p>

<h3>Pricing Model And LockIn</h3>

<p>Initial thought was to just make it free.</p>

<p>If developers and people who currently pay a small VPS for a moderate known site just donate 50% of their current hosting costs it should be more than enough. I refuse to even talk and think about a sell-out or an ad based model.</p>

<p>I see Zenbo-hosted as a fun side project and I do not care if I make $5 or invest $5 as long as I do not pay thousands of dollars every month for other peoples blog. I want this service, I build this service. (The implementation I currently build for my company is definitely nothing I or other tech-savvy people would love to use. It targets a complete different group of people.)</p>

<p>Now you could ask: "Why should we trust him to provide a service I like?" or "what if he screws up and notices that his blue eyed, trusting in mankind, pricing model does not work?" I have a pretty easy answer. Zenbo-hosted, as Zenbo, will be open source. If you like the way it works - roll your own. If you start hating Zenbo, you already have a full copy of your content on your hard disk. I cannot think of a way how it would be easier to migrate everything away.</p>

<h3>Me Likes, Me Wants</h3>

<p>If you are interested in Zenbo-hosted just drop me a line, a tweet, send a bird with a message or set something on fire, dance around it and make some smoke signals.</p>

<p>I will build the tools around Zenbo-hosted in some weekend- or evening sessions and release them. I am just not sure if enough people would like seeing me buy some servers and providing everything as a service.</p>

                <title>My Stack Is Bigger Than Yours - Ranting About Web Applications And Scalability</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>Building a web application is serious business. Reading start up blogs, High Scalability or other sites you see many different tools, opinions how stuff should be designed and build, how you should deploy everything and of course even more opinions why this particular stack is superior to everything else. Sadly people who read this believe they have to do the same things and use as many tools as everyone else does.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Let me give you an example. I build <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/8/14/the_road_to_zenbo_1_0.html">Zenbo</a> and I am currently using it for two clients. They both want a contact form and one of them also wants a form for his job page so people can submit an application. I was aware that this would eventually happen when I was writing Zenbo and I also had a plan for this situation: Writing a backend service. Use Ajax to send the form to it and store it. Send users a mail that there is a new message and add a web interface so they can check it and mark it as 'read'.</p>

<p>This is the trivial version which covers the immediate needs. There are some plans for extending it, but they will need some time and will likely be finished at the end of the year.</p>

<p>The basic plan is using Zenbo for as much projects as possible and provide a solid hosting service. Scaling is easy, sites can look the way my clients and I want them to look and with some backend power there is not drawback. So it could be possible that I will have to add more features and face some serious traffic.</p>

<h3>How To Solve This The Start Up Way</h3>

<p>If I build dynamic sites I use Django. But my backend is more of a service and an API. Naturally Flask came to my mind. If you do not know why I suggest you take a look at Kenneth Reitz - "Why Django sucks". But I could also think of Ruby On Rails which is, in my humble opinion, a good framework for fast and basic REST and CRUD.</p>

<p>I thought about joining all fields, storing them in one key and let the frontend handle the presentation. There is no need for indexing and searching, so it does not hurt. A key (client specific) with a value (form data) are the easiest way to use the same backend for all clients. If I think of key value storage I think of Redis. Adding store to PostgreSQL could also work.</p>

<p>Sending EMails? Just add a job to Celery. A queue systems and some worker scripts should be fine.</p>

<p>Webinterface? Well, it could be great to build a single page application so it feels responsive and improves the user experience. Node.js is the new black for SPAs. </p>

<p>Deployment? As much as I love Fabric, Chef seems to do a better job. Not sure about that, but most start ups seem to choose Chef over Fabric and they are all pretty smart - so they should know what they are doing, right?</p>

<p>So what do we have so far? </p>

<p>Programming/Scripting languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>Frameworks, applications and tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>Zenbo</li>
<li>Flask</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Celery</li>
<li>Chef</li>
<li>Redis</li>
</ul>

<p>We use the best tools and best frameworks for every part of the system. This is great, right?</p>

<h3>How To Solve It In A Sane Way</h3>

<p>Write a freaking Django application. Use the tools you know are often suggested and most of the time sufficient. It is easy to learn most of the tools I mentioned, especially since I know most of the stuff already and would only need to look up some stuff I do not have present in my mind.</p>

<p>Add the application to <code>/backend</code> and post your data. Store it in a PostgreSQL database with three fields. Id, key, value. Create a web interface. If a user logs in query the database, read all entries where <code>key</code> matches the user key and show the values in a nice way.</p>

<h3>The Big Difference</h3>

<p>While installing everything I mentioned in the "start up stack" I created the basic application mentioned in the "sane stack". Does this mean that the start up stack is stupid or that they are doing it all wrong? Well... no.</p>

<p>Most of them have to handle a different load than I will face in the first few months. And I would not buy an additional server when I encounter the first load problems. I am aware of the possibilities and I can easily separate the backend from the frontend, add a task queue or improve the user experience for big data sets.</p>

<p>Until this happens I do not waste time developing and creating things I may never need. I do not waste time maintaining a stack of frameworks and languages I currently do not need. I keep it small and easy until I need it. But I consider the possibilities and try to make sure I can easily add the option to scale.</p>

<p>Why do I not just create a Django or Flask application for each client? Because using Zenbo, I can just host more small sites on one server. I can keep the hosting and administration costs low. Everyone wins.</p>

<h3>Why Do I Rant About This?</h3>

<p>I have recently talked to some friends who work on their first product and start up. And they fall into the big "everyone is doing it"-trap. Just because other start ups use something does not mean you have to, even if their arguments make sense. They have different needs, they have different engineers, they have different use cases.</p>

<p>The best advices I could give them were</p>

<ul>
<li>keep your stack as small as possible</li>
<li>always keep scaling in mind</li>
<li>only scale when you need it</li>
<li>use what you know</li>
<li>"it works" is good enough most of the time</li>
</ul>

<p>This will not work for everyone, though. Look at App.net for example: They knew that they will face a certain load. It would have made no sense to deliver fast and ignore scaling. The whole business model is build around the fact that they have to grow as fast as possible, which means scaling.</p>

                <title>In Defense Of Being Obsessed</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>In nearly all kinds of media you hear about those obsessed people who are just bad, evil and likely terrorists or psychopaths. Why? Because they are obsessed. What they never tell you is that an obsession can be something great. Not if you want to live a boring, standard life like your neighbor and his neighbor and so on.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Every time I hear about people explaining why it is such a bad thing I try to not join the discussion. I stay away as far from it as I can. I would know what I am talking about but since they do everything to believe that an obsession is bad and should be treated - you would have an easier time arguing with a blind person about what blue looks like.</p>

<p>Before I continue let me define the term "average life". I mean a regular life. You have friends, many hobbies, a job. You are not trying to do something amazing and are happy just getting up, complaining a bit about your job, going home to your friends and family,â€¦ you just live from day to day, sometimes thinking about the future. I do not try to argue about that lifestyle and I do not judge or care about it. Just wanted to get this out before misunderstandings happen. :)</p>

<p>When I was in school I did not really care about parties. I went to some but most of the time I was in front of my computer. When other people went to Spain to drink themselves into oblivion I organized network parties. Others were hiding a Playboy under their bed, I was just reading computer magazines. Looking back at my youth I was obsessed with computers. Well, I still am.</p>

<p>But I have a tendency to this behavior. When I started training martial arts I went from zero to 5 days training a week. I wanted to play the guitar and my teacher told me to first learn the flute to understand notes and stuff. He said I would have to practice a year. After 4 month I got my guitar.</p>

<p>There is an easy way how I explain the way I learn and practice things. "If it is worth doing, give 100%. If you are not ready to give 100% just do not do it." Personally I just do not like half assed attempts.</p>

<p>From time to time I look back to see how far I have gotten. I remember 15 years acting this way. People told me that I am obsessed and that I should do something else than spending my whole time with computers. They told me I annoy them talking about it. That my life would suck because I have nothing else. (A quote from the mother of an old friend.) People in my class did not really like me (but neither did I like them).</p>

<p>When I was 16 and still in school preparing for my diploma I started my first company. After finishing it I started a second one together with a training in a completely different profession. I am self employed and earning money since I was 16. I did not need my parents to pay for my car. I was able to move in my own apartment and live on my own when I finished school.</p>

<p>People who went to school with me are still studying. They need their parents to support them. They have no idea what work is like, but believe they will have an easy life because they studied. They do not really work hard, do not have good grades,â€¦ They are just average and the only thing they want is making enough money to pay a car and alcohol. They already resigned and subscribed to an average life. While talking to some of them I learned that they do not even see or imagine that something else would be possible.</p>

<p>Looking back at my school time and every time people told me I would live a sad life because I am obsessed with things makes me smile. Thanks to my obsession I enjoy my life. I am good at the things I do. I am even great in some of them. I do not have to regret not doing things because I did everything I really wanted to do. I gave everything and if I could not achieve a goal, I never had to think: "if I would just had tried harder".</p>

<p>Now please do not get me wrong. I understand that there is a clinical type of obsession that is not healthy. I am not talking about this one. If you stalk a girl or forget to eat and drink because you are sitting in a tree trying to catch a bird to make sweet, sweet love to it you should really look for help. There is some kind of illness but I am not talking about that.</p>

<p>In the end the only thing that counts is a happy, full filled live. If an average life, no stress, no pressure to achieve things is what makes you happy - go for it. But just one little thing (and I believe it is not too much to ask for): If your friend, your fiancee, your daughter or son are obsessed (in a not clinical or critical way) do not tell them they are doing something wrong or that their life sucks. There is a reason and maybe they are onto something and one day achieve great things. And if they don't, they will not regret anything. Living obsessed is for them what living an average life is for you.</p>

                <title>On Patents, Apple, Samsung And Innovation</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>I love reading all those posts that the patent system is evil (I agree to some point on this one), that Samsung should have won and that Apple did not invent anything. Let me just talk about one thing. But there is one little thing so many smart people either do not understand or always get wrong.
<!--MORE--></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They should not be able to get a patent for $foo, it is so trivial</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you think $foo is so trivial that everyone could come up with it and that it does not deserve a patent. Let me ask you one question. Why? Did you think of it?</p>

<p>If it would be so easy someone else would have done it before Apple. But no one did. They either did not figure out how to do it or how to ship a product that uses it. No matter which one it is, Apple (in most cases) were doing it first.</p>

<p>After someone had an idea and showed how it is supposed to work it is easy to say: "everyone could do this". But the art is doing it before someone shows you how to do it.</p>

<h3>Everyone Is A Patent Lawyer</h3>

<p>This is the feeling I have reading some rants. Everyone knows what is worth a patent and which patents should be granted and which should be revoked. The problem is that most people only look at this from a technical point of view. This is only half the truth.</p>

<p>Could everyone think of "swipe to unlock"? Yes. Of course. But Apple shipped the first products. And if I see someone swiping at the bottom of a device I think of an iPhone or iPad. I do not think "smartphone" or "tablet". I think of Apple. So I think of an Samsung smartphone if someone is making wild gestures on the screen.</p>

<p>They were the first company shipping a product gaining a significant market share. How people see devices is a one of the reasons we see lawsuits about the look and feel and user experience. Not because they just have a patent. People who do not care about the technical details see characteristics of devices. This is, what we call selling points. You know, the stuff that makes money because people use it as an indicator if they like a device. And if you are the first to come up with a solution how to do something people easily remember and like you want your fair share if others use it.</p>

<p>So arguing that the idea is trivial does not mean it is not worth a patent. Neither you nor I know how much work is behind "trivial". Saying you could have come up with it is easy. They showed you how it is working.</p>

<h3>Patents Done Wrong - Banning Products</h3>

<p>Now do not get me wrong. I believe someone who invented something should get a fair compensation if other companies make money with it. And if everyone would stick to this easy thing there would not be money and time be wasted that could have been invested in development and innovation.</p>

<p>Now if a company buys a patent they normally pay a lot money. Saying "give us $10 if you use it" is in my opinion valid. They paid for the patent to use it. They own it. Instantly trying to ban products is just idiotic. Banning a product is always the wrong move.</p>

<p>Yes, you have competitors. Of course it would be great if they vanish. But did you think of the people who just do not want your product but the other one. They will not just magically buy an iPhone if they wanted and Android or the other way around. You just piss them off. Look at the judge who banned both Apple and Samsung products in South Korea. Now they can buy Nokia. Yay for them,â€¦</p>

<p>Easy solution: Play fair. If you are not able to invent something and copy it from someone else just pay them. You still make profit. Likely more than you would have made if you would have had developed your own, creepy, half assed solution.</p>

<h3>I Just Want Innovation</h3>

<p>Apple, most of the time, has a patent, gives companies a fair chance to buy the rights to use it. Samsung is copying Apple as hard as they can. Even retail stores,â€¦ I remember that they even put up (Apple) AppStore icons on a wall. Google is buying what they can buy and start lawsuits (Motorola, anyone?).</p>

<p>Is this the whole truth? Is Apple always the good guy? Maybe not. They are still a company. And I do not believe you get all informations reading some reports to make a final decision if it is correct what is happening or not.</p>

<p>In the end I really do not care. Just pay the other company if they invented it and put all your money and time in your products. This is what makes customers happy. Everything else is just for the trolls.</p>

                <title>Review: iA Writer</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>In my 25 years on earth I was called many things. But poet or author is not on the list. I am not exceptionally good at writing nor is it easy for me. Still I am sitting in front of my screen and writing this words that should, somehow, maybe magically, become a review of a program which can only do one thing: show an edit field so you can enter text.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Imagine you are an ordinary geek who loves to share his sarcastic, sometimes not really well researched, highly opinionated rants with the rest of the world. You look for some blogging software, maybe you use a <a href="http://fallenhitokiri.tumblr.com">hosted service</a>, maybe you <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/8/14/the_road_to_zenbo_1_0.html">write it yourself</a>. After all the things you consider fun you are sitting in front of your computer and have to write something so you can share it with the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Maybe you stick to the default input method of your software. Some creepy AJAX interface that was only build for one purpose: annoy you till you start screaming at your screen, threatening to kill a puppy and quit your browser. Maybe you just fire up {vim/emacs} since everything else you do happens in there so why not writing? For all the fancy people among us add Sublime Text to the list.</p>

<p>Of course you read some blogs and tech sites. And there is one kind of software you regularly read about and just do not understand why every journalist in the world acts like they found the cure for cancer. I am talking about writing software that takes possession of your screen and only shows you the line you are currently writing. Stupid journalists, I could write something similar in some hours.</p>

<p>You read more reviews and cannot get rid of the feeling you are missing something. Maybe it is not a technical point. Maybe those people who make their living with writing have a reason to pay a lot of cash for something this trivial. A lot of cash for an edit field with some styling. Stupid journalists.</p>

<p>But then, one day, you decide that you have to give it a try. Some more articles about similar software appeared and you start considering that you could be missing something. You pay 8â‚¬, luckily it was on sale, for the OSX application and 0.79â‚¬ for the iOS version. Why both of them? If you want to give it a fair chance you should have use both of them if you own an iOS device. More about this later. After a short download you have a new button on every device you own. iA <a href="http://www.iawriter.com">Writer</a>.</p>

<p>After the first start you give it the "unimpressed" glance. A nice minimal application. An edit field. With a blue cursor. After suppressing the "I could have written this myself" feeling you start typing. You have a vague idea for a blog post and just type. And you reach the end of the screen and still see everything you have written. Where is the magic? Where is the focus mode? Oh, right, <em>click</em> activated. You look at it for a moment and continue writing.</p>

<p>After some time you hit [command][s] and leave focus mode. Shocked you look at the bottom of your screen. Reading time "8 minutes". Around 1900 words. I think I wrote less in the exam for my diploma and still got a decent grade.</p>

<p>Is this the magic behind the cheap 5 hour edit field styling? Maybe. The fact that you can focus your eyes on the middle of your screen and do not have to look around, see nothing but the line you are currently writing is a pleasant experience. But is it worth 8â‚¬ or even 16â‚¬? I would say yes. You do not only get a nice editor for writing. You even get all the default OSX features every editor with a native edit field has like grammar and spelling correction for free! While I did not consider the font that important, my girlfriend even called it ugly, you get used to it. Not sure why but after some time you start liking it. Stockholm syndrome?</p>

<p>This is only where the magic begins. Open Writer on your iPad, start outlining a post or write some paragraphs, open it on your Mac and continue. The iCloud synchronization is great. No need to search DropBox, nothing you have to do but writing. You really only do this one thing. Writing. Writer takes care of the rest. It does not offer options. There is no customization. There is nothing that takes away your focus form the actual task.</p>

<p>The biggest question is: "Do I really believe it is worth spending 18â‚¬ (and I think it will also be something around $18) for 'just' that?" The answer is easy. Yes. No matter if you are a professional journalist or just some geek blogging, Writer will make it a great experience. I do not know how and I refuse to try to explain it since I have no idea what I should explain. But writing is fun. It is not stressful. There is nothing getting in your way.</p>

<p>I am no poet or author. I think I never will be one. But I used many different applications. Starting from S9y, MovableType, Wordpress, Vim, TextWrangler, Sublime Text,â€¦ and many more. I I wrote code, I wrote blog posts, sometimes on sick days, when I was really confused and not myself even some bits of documentation. In 15 years writing on a computer (yes I was lucky and was allowed to write my first big homework on my dads computer) it never felt so good, so natural, so fun. Just as a side note. The integrated markdown support is really nice. After getting used to it you will miss in in every other editor.</p>

<p>I have no idea why. I cannot explain it after four month using it and I cannot give you well-founded reasons. But if you write or consider writing, even if you only write 4 blog posts a year for 3 people reading them, go and buy Writer. It will be worth every cent.</p>

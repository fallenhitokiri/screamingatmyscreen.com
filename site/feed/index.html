                <title>Selling Your Service Or Product - The Basics</title>
                <link>http://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/2012/11/selling-your-service-or-product-the-basics/</link>
                <description><p>Last week I was talking to 14 boys and girls about IT. Their school offered an orientation day and I was invited as a speaker. One of them was especially interested in selling products. Now this is something I wanted to talk about for a long time on my blog. Maybe you remember the <a href="/2012/5/time-to-talk-about-business/">"talk about business"</a> series?
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>I used to make a big part of my living as consultant for eight years. I had the opportunity to learn from great, international coaches and at the same time practice what I learned. The basic idea of selling and consulting is always the same - no matter if we talk about software or a vacuum cleaner. And still so many people (even big companies) do it horrible wrong. Of course really big companies get away with it most of the time, but this is due to other factors. For us it is interesting to know how we should market and sell our product or the service we just built.</p>

<h2>Marketing And Selling Is Important</h2>

<p>I know enough people who think sales persons or marketing departments are utterly useless. They believe a great product is enough. Most of the time those people are the ones who build fantastic applications, hardware or services. Sadly those are the same people who do not understand that not everyone is like them. If they see something new and think it could be interesting they give it a try. Other people just don't.</p>

<p>Customers do not want stunning websites with a lot of descriptions what a great product can do. They do not even care about the built-in cheese grater. They want someone who listens to their problems and tells them how they can fix it with this special product. Some tech-savvy, misanthropic assholes will be offended and disagree, but "humans need humans" was, is and will be a universal truth.</p>

<p>No matter how good your product is, if no one knows about it, if your competitors send someone with a demonstration device to potential customers or if people do not fully understand your product no one will buy it. Not even if it is the best one available.</p>

<h2>Know Your Product</h2>

<p>If you do not know the product you cannot sell it. It is really that easy. If your potential customers asks questions and you have no idea or have to call someone or read your own flyer - then you have a problem. There is nothing that makes selling harder to impossible than being caught off guard on basic questions.</p>

<p>This does not mean you have to know every little detail. You should know if your web service is able to send newsletters to customers. You do not have to know how to partition databases to scale it.</p>

<p>There is a difference between knowing a product and knowing every detail. On the one hand, you should know as much as possible - but on the other hand it's no shame to call your office and ask a developer if and how this special scenario could be realized. </p>

<p>If a client has some special needs and you talk to one of your developers before promising that it will work you have another advantage: Your client can be sure that you are not just some sales person promising pink ponies to land a deal. At least this is what clients believe. Developers know the software they build and what it is capable of, right?</p>

<h2>Know Your Contenders</h2>

<p>If you are selling a software as a service, for example, then you have to know your competitors. What if a potential client already is a customer of someone else? What if they ask you about the differences to evaluate which solutions fits their needs? You have to be able to answer those questions. But there is one thing you should not do:</p>

<p>Never start telling your potential customers why other products suck. Never ever.</p>

<p>I cannot stress this enough. If you are not explicitly asked about the differences, you talk about the strengths and advantages of your product. And if you are asked you talk about the strengths and advantages of your product.</p>

<p>I know some people will call me fanboy for this one but the example just works. Imagine an elderly women who wants to buy a smartphone. You tell her that the new Samsung Galaxy 7 has a 90" screen, 500 cores and 45 petabyte memory. 
I just give her an iPhone, tell her to type the number of her daughter, hit FaceTime and she can see her grandchild.</p>

<p>You can tell her that the iPhone has far inferior hardware. 
I can tell her how easy it is to use and that she can always call her daughter and see her grandchildren rise. I do not have to explain to her why the specs don't matter, manufacturing quality or anything else.</p>

<p>Some of you might now argue that this example is wrong because the Galaxy and "what if"â€¦ you get the point. This example sucks, but it's the best one I can come up with at the moment. Let us continue.</p>

<h3>If You Have A Bad Product</h3>

<p>You should be aware of the weaknesses of your product.
There is, most of the time, not only one product for a certain task and most of the time you have different trade offs if you choose one of the products over another.</p>

<p>But what do you do when your product is just bad? Cheap components, known problems, not matching any use case?</p>

<p>Stop selling it. If you sell crap people will notice at a certain point. Get another job.</p>

<p>There was a new client I visited for the first time. Coffee was prepared and it was just a matter of "What do you need?", "What makes sense for you?", questions and statements. 
How did I get this client? Another client recommended me. </p>

<p>The new client knew that I do not make promises I cannot fulfill and that I also admit if there are weaknesses in one of the products or scenarios where it is problematic. And still, I did not need to convince him that those products are still worth buying. I showed him how he can solve the problem he has with the product I have. Nothing more. </p>

<p>This appointment only went so smooth because a previous client recommended me. Not my product. Customers and clients sometimes care more about the people who sell something than about the actual product. This also means that you do not sell them something they do not need - or your reputation will suffer.</p>

<h2>Service Always Starts After You Sold</h2>

<p>Take care of problems. Call or email your new customer personally. Do not let your secretary handle everything. Know their birthday. Maybe, if it came up in a conversation, the birthdays of wife, husband or kids. Remember the dates and gratulate them personally.</p>

<p>This is one of the differences between selling something and building a client relationship. Be nice, keep your promises and from time to time just let him know you remember him without directly calling to sell something.</p>

<p>Maybe you have candy or other merchandise stuff with your company brand. Throw it away. Kids do not want company branded chocolate. They want an ordinary chocolate bar they know and like. Most of the time this branded stuff tastes awful, and no one needs yet another ruler.</p>

<p>Know what your client likes. Wine, Whisky or chocolate - get something that tastes good without your brand. These are birthday or Christmas gifts people remember. Especially if you have a present for their kids or even a snack for their pets. </p>

<h2>In A Nutshell</h2>

<p>These are only rough, not completely elaborated points about best practices. They can be a bit different depending on your country, on your product, your personality and your client.</p>

<p>But there are some things I consider to be a universal truth:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be honest</li>
<li>You have to sell to make money</li>
<li>Talk about strengths of your product</li>
<li>Treat other people with respect</li>
<li>Keep promises</li>
<li>Only sell if it makes sense for the customer</li>
<li>Don't sell garbage</li>
<li>Service starts after the deal is closed</li>
<li>A good reputation is essential</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot more to say about selling and marketing and I will likely take the time and talk about every point in its own post.</p>

<p>But if you now think: "Doh, of course! This is simple. No need to talk about this stuff!", ask yourself if every sales and support person you encountered in your life followed this easy and simple principles we should not even have to mention.</p>

<p>But now that the basics are clear we can talk about some more serious and in depth about those points.</p>

                <title>Django Beginner Series - Introduction</title>
                <link>http://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/2012/11/django-beginner-series-introduction/</link>
                <description><p>Some Twitter followers could already know that I am working on a book. Just not what it is about. Big announcement: It will be about web application development using Django. It is supposed to be an easy entry in the world of Django and tries to cover as much as possible in a simple way to get started with the framework.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>If you do not care why I am doing this skip to "ideas and how this blog is involved" to get an idea what tutorials I will post in the course of the next weeks.</p>

<p>Django is the best documented project I know. You can find nearly anything in the documentation and if you are not comfortable browsing it you can just read the code with comments. But there is something Django lacks. I know that not everyone agrees with me on this. But I also know how many people asked me basic things they could not figure out just from reading the tutorial. Django needs some basic introduction material.</p>

<p>I do not think it would be wise to rewrite the whole documentation. If I want to know something about a model field, how a battery works or just see if there is something I am missing about a problem the documentation is great. But it does not walk you through the process of creating a basic application that actually works. At least not good enough as it looks to me.</p>

<p>I am aware that there are great resources and that there is even a "community driven book". But this brings me to another point. There are nearly no books written in German about Django. I think I have seen one. Sometimes it only has a little paragraph, maybe a chapter in a book about Python but nothing serious. Other books, written in English, are just so outdated it hurts.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with Django and my company realizes projects based on it on a regular basis. I would love to see more people using Django and I think this could be a way to give something back to the project. A little thank you, spreading the word and showing the great possibilities and reasons why more people should consider using Django.</p>

<h2>Ideas And How This Blog Is Involved</h2>

<p>I know that I am not in the position to provide a solid English translation of the book directly after it is finished. Not without some help. And I am also not sure when I will find the time to translate it. So I had another idea.</p>

<p>In the book I will use examples that are supposed to help my readers with real world problems. We will build</p>

<ul>
<li>a basic content management system</li>
<li>some kind of wiki</li>
<li>a tumblelog</li>
<li>something that will remind you of Twitter</li>
</ul>

<p>Beside the basic idea how to start such projects I can introduce management commands, migrations, templating, user accounts and profiles, project layout and structure and other stuff without boring everyone to death.</p>

<p>To reach more people I will link the examples in this blog and add tutorials how everything is put together.</p>

<p>The four "big projects" are currently only ideas. I am still looking for some input what I should include and what I should leave out of the tutorials. The goal is pretty simple: "Introduce enough features so everyone has a basic understanding how Django works and hopefully will be able to realize any project with the help of the documentation". I refuse to copy big parts of the docs, this would make the whole project pointless.</p>

<p>If you have any ideas, wishes or comments send me a <a href="mailto:timo@screamingatmyscreen.com">mail</a>, comment on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4749368">Hacker News</a> or send me a <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fallenhitokiri">tweet</a>.</p>

                <title>The iPad Mini Is Not For You</title>
                <link>http://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/2012/10/the-ipad-mini-is-not-for-you/</link>
                <description><p>Yesterday Apple introduced the iPad mini. As always I had two different types of people in my Twitter timeline. Those who tried to order it before the keynote was finished and those who explained why the iPad mini is a big disappointment. I believe it is great, just not for "us".
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>With "us" I mean me and likely everyone who is reading this blog. There are some exceptions, of course. Those who want a small eBook reader without sacrifycing the features of an iPad will be happy with the iPad mini. Everyone else will stick to the iPad as we know it.</p>

<h2>iPad mini As eBook Reader</h2>

<p>I recently started using my iPad to read a book. First I was not sure if I like a display in front of me or if it will be comfortable enough. I've been reading books for some years now and I am just used to those paper things. It works. Always. They are never low on battery, never required a charger, are instantly on, I do not have to update them and can always read them, not only in areas where books are "allowed". But I thought I should give eBooks a fair chance.</p>

<p>Three days later I am convinced that I will stick to it. It is easier to handle, I do not have to find a light source (I read in my bed most of the time) and, even if it is a lot of fun, I do not have to visit a book store if I do not want to. I also trust Apple to not pull an <a href="http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/">Amazon</a> on me.</p>

<p>But since I am not one of the biggest book lovers on earth I talked to my spouse. She basically owns more books than every library I know and still believes it is not enough. Books are her shoes. She explained to me that the iPad is nice but a bit too big for her liking to effectively replace a book. So the iPad mini would be ideal for her to replace books - only talking about size and weight, not the fact that some part of her is a little book snob and likely will never joining the digital gang.</p>

<h3>No Retina Display</h3>

<p>I do not see the lack of a retina display as bad. I still use my iPad first generation to read books. Of course a retina display is nice. But as long as you do not directly compare both displays to each other, the first generation iPad is still fairly good for reading.</p>

<p>Now the iPad mini has the same resolution on a smaller display. PPI are nearer to the retina display, even if still not there. We have to wait till someone actually uses the device to know if it is "near enough".</p>

<h2>Features, Specs and Quality</h2>

<p>I had a short <a href="https://twitter.com/fallenhitokiri/status/260836338230775808">tweet-exchange</a> with Jeff Croft. He is not really a big fan of the specs. There is no point in arguing, he is right.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-in-reply-to="260831959926841344"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/fallenhitokiri">fallenhitokiri</a> Totally agree. More than happy to pay a premium for high-end build quality. A 65% premium AND a shitty screen, tho? Too much</p>&mdash; Jeff Croft (@jcroft) <a href="https://twitter.com/jcroft/status/260832245034647552" data-datetime="2012-10-23T19:57:07+00:00">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This little piece of tech is not bleeding edge. It does not have a retina display. It is not the fastest tablet the world has ever seen. It is small. It is a full featured iOS device. It is cheap compared to its "big brothers". It is a device you buy if you want iOS and not pay half a monthly income.</p>

<p>But the big difference to other tablets or eBook readers is iOS. I cannot stress this enough. Full featured iOS device for ~$300. If you really only want to read eBooks you have to decide if you want <a href="http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/">Amazon DRM</a> or Apple. Hard decision when you can go for Apple and get both services and some more iOS magic.</p>

<p>What is not questionable is the iPad mini vs all other Android devices around $200-$300. I want quality. Not plastic. It is that easy. Most cheap tablets I hold in my hands so far wereâ€¦ cheap. You notice it when you hold them, when you touch them and when you type on them.</p>

<h2>Target Group</h2>

<p>Even if the specs are not premium the overall quality still is. And this is another big selling point. You get Apple quality and software for a low entry price.</p>

<p>Most people I have seen being disappointed by the iPad mini are tech-savvy. They know what a CPU is, they know what a retina display is and they do more than just reading a mail and a book or sometimes visiting a homepage to see if their favorite sports team won.</p>

<p>You can consider the iPad mini an gateway drug. You want iOS and Apple quality but you are still not sold on it. Now you do not discuss if you can spare &gt; $500. You think about $300. It makes a big difference.</p>

<p>If you take away all the tech stuff we all love (and just look at use cases and money you have to spend to get a device which is capable of fulfilling your needs) the iPad mini magically appears to make sense.</p>

<h2>I Am Not Disappointed</h2>

<p>But I still will not buy it. I do not have to optimize applications for another display resolution, I am comfortable with a bigger screen and I want retina. It is easy. The big one.</p>

<p>My parents on the other hand just read some mails, sometimes visit a sports site, look at a power point presentation or FaceTime with me. Do they need all those fancy features, specs and power? No.</p>

<p>Maybe Kenneth Reitz is right, at least it could be possible and I see a chance that this will happen.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>If the iPad Mini launches today at $300 or less, I fully expect it to replace desktop computers for 90% of my family members.</p>&mdash; Kenneth Reitz (@kennethreitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/kennethreitz/status/260734427531984896" data-datetime="2012-10-23T13:28:26+00:00">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Let us be honest. Most people do not need a computer. They need an email client and a browser on a device they cannot break or mess up. Overall quality and usability are more important than specs.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The iPad mini is great for people who do not care about specs, want a tool for a limited range of certain tasks and are not willing to pay a lot of money to get a device for trivial things which has features they do not care about.
Everyone else will stick to its bigger brothers.</p>

                <title>Zenbo, Zenbo As A Service And Pricing</title>
                <link>http://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/2012/10/zenbo-zenbo-as-a-service-and-pricing/</link>
                <description><p>After a week of working on Zenbo (and desperately searching for a new name, as this one is already protected by someone else) there are some news I want to share with you. Sadly not everything worked as expected and there were some private issues I had to take care of. But the good news are that I am on a good track for a release. Let me give you an overview what happened and what you can expect.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>First of all there were some major commits and pushes to the <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/Zenbo">GitHub repository</a>. Some changes that look small but make a lot of sense if you take the greater picture into consideration.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Each plugin will now ship with a default configuration. This means that you can, if you are happy with the defaults, run with a configuration file that only consists of three lines. A major step for people starting to use Zenbo.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are some things left to do. There will be a way to run Zenbo with defaults and command line arguments. This is needed for the hosting.</p>

<h3>Plugins</h3>

<p>There are no categories for plugins anymore. There is just a plugin with a <code>run</code> method in a class called <code>Feature</code>. The order in which plugins are executed is determinate by the order in which they are listed in the configuration file.</p>

<p>This makes it easy to add a base class for common features which will happen at one point. This way configuration handling will be provided by Zenbo and not be the job of every plugin and plugin author.</p>

<h3>Usability</h3>

<p>Today I started working on a way to setup a new site with <code>zenbo --init</code>. It is still a bit rough around the edges but I think it will be done tomorrow. The goal is making it easy for people without prior Zenbo experience getting a site up and running with one command. Deployment excluded.</p>

<h2>Zenbo As A Service</h2>

<p>I talked about <a href="http://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/2012/9/23/updates_on_zenbo_and_zenbo-hosted.html">zenbo-hosted</a>. Some people asked why we need another hosting and blogging service. The answer is pretty easy. I want it for my own and my companies projects.</p>

<p>Most of the time there is no reason for full featured content management systems and there is also no reason to waste money of clients for server resources and hosting they do not really need. With Zenbo as a service there is a way to edit sites in the browser and still benefit from the advantages of a static generated site.</p>

<p>Everyone who prefers a fast and easy to use hosting service, who wants to edit files locally and test a site before it goes live, designers who love the freedom doing what they want, not being tied to the annoyances and limitations of a CMS, everyone who loves git and vim will hopefully enjoy it.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>

<p>There will be a longer post how everything will work but a quick overview.</p>

<p>The backend will be hosted on a dedicated server. Adding content, no matter if you push with git or add it through the web interface will cause a commit in the git repository which will trigger a hook that starts generating your site.</p>

<p>Between the generation and the repository will be Celery which will make sure the same site is not generated multiple times parallel, that there are not 500 processes fighting over system resources and finally notify the front end if everything is fine or if problems occurred. My last tests indicate that generating 100 sites parallel should be fine on a small box. And thanks to some revised design decisions it will be easy to just add more or bigger boxes.</p>

<p>The final site will be hosted on S3. This will add a hughe performance boost over one or two server and cut down costs. If a customer still wants more performance I will offer a CloudFront add-on. This is, at least for my current knowledge, the fastest possible site you can have. No backend wasting time on generating content, servers near every customer visiting your site, in one word: performance.</p>

<h3>Pricing</h3>

<p>Now that I had some time evaluating my options I decided what the pricing will look like. Thanks to an Amazon Web Services event in Leipzig I had the opportunity to talk to some people and answer some open questions.</p>

<p>Zenbo-hosted will be free for everything which is non-commercial. There will be some strings attached to it. Those are still a topic that has to be discussed.</p>

<ul>
<li>private sites will always be free</li>
<li>no advertisement, or anything else</li>
<li>no file hosting</li>
<li>non-profit organizations have special rules</li>
</ul>

<h3>File Hosting</h3>

<p>This is just a matter of costs. I want to keep the service free with no strings attached for private usage. Putting up a 2MB PDF with your rÃ©sumÃ© is fine. Images and image galleries are fine. Uploading the last season of Buffy you just ripped for your friends is not cool. Not only because of the costs but also because of all the DMCA stuff I would have to answer.</p>

<h3>Non-profit Organizations</h3>

<p>Most of the time they cause some decent traffic and have some money at their hands for organizational costs. The only thing that changes is that they are halt to put "powered by Zenbo-hosted" in the footer of the site.</p>

<p>If a non-profit organization decides to use Zenbo I hope they will get in touch with me. I would be happy to support them and provide add-on packages as a donation.</p>

<h3>Companies</h3>

<p>Basically pretty easy. $5 / month as basic plan and you pay what you use. That is it. Without any add-ons this is everything you have to pay for.</p>

<h3>Add-Ons</h3>

<p>There will be several add-on packages you can order which will be a paid service. I am not sure if they will be all available at the beginning but they should appear in the course of this year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Post by mail</li>
<li>Hosting files</li>
<li>Dedicated backend</li>
<li>Mail service</li>
<li>API to submit any form you put on your site</li>
<li>Custom plugins</li>
<li>Domain service / DNS</li>
<li>AWS CloudFront support</li>
</ul>

<p>Beside the file hosting all features will be around $1 to $3 a month. I think this is reasonable and affordable.</p>

<h2>Why Am I Building This?</h2>

<p>Because I believe people will enjoy using it. Because I want to offer a different approach to classic hosting services. Because it is fun. Because it will be beneficial for my company. Because I hope some people who did amazing stuff that helped me do my job and run my business will notice it and use it - my way of saying "thank you".</p>

<p>There are many reasons. For me, the most important ones are fun, saying "thank you" and providing a solid base for future projects I and my company will be working on.</p>

                <title>Updates On Zenbo And Zenbo-hosted</title>
                <link>http://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/2012/9/updates-on-zenbo-and-zenbo-hosted/</link>
                <description><p>After a week of doing nearly nothing, thanks to a really bad cold, I managed to get some testing and coding done. I thought I give you some updates how your favorite project is doing and how soon you will see the release of the last blogging platform you will ever need.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>This is one of the names and slogans that were suggested for Zenbo-hosted. While I liked this one, even if it maybe not 100% accurate, here are some more.</p>

<ul>
<li>yet another blogging platform</li>
<li>static blogging</li>
<li>scaled blogging</li>
<li>blogging with fun again</li>
</ul>

<p>I also thought about just using Zenbo. Name the service after the core software that is used. I had far worser ideas, believe me. The final decisions will be made in some weeks, so I am not really stressed making my mind up.</p>

<h3>Zenbo</h3>

<p>Today Zenbo learned what tags are and how they work. The documentation is not really finished but I did not find any bugs in the implementation so I just pushed it to the <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/Zenbo">repository on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>One of the main things I have to fix before the first release will be the way Zenbo reads and uses the configuration. A plugin should ship with sane defaults. Currently you have to add all configuration options to <code>config.yaml</code> which is not really comfortable, fast or clean.</p>

<p>Also it will be a lot easier to integrate Zenbo in zenbo-hosted if the configuration is internally represented as an object.</p>

<p>I think we will see the last beta version next week. After adding some more tests and finished the crawler everything should be ready for 1.0.0, except the documentation which is a different topic.</p>

<h3>Zenbo-hosted</h3>

<p>I have a basic implementation of the backend. Currently only working if the backend and web server are running on the same server. Separating the backend from the fronted needs some time. I am not sure if I will just use <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.4.3/index.html">Fabric</a> or integrate SSH to run commands on a remote system. Fabric seems to be the better way.</p>

<p>Adding multiple fronted servers on the other hand is already integrated. To be honest I am just to lazy to change the database scheme, even if it is quiet easy thanks to <a href="http://south.aeracode.org">South</a>.</p>

<p>I am also not happy with the way I create git repositories. I subprocess too much for my taste but finding a python git library that does not suck is not as easy as it sounds.</p>

<p>Pricing is also nearly set. Free for non-commercial use. I am not sure how to price companies but I thought about something like 10k requests / $x. Not sure what x needs to be to make this service sustainable.</p>

<p>I have some work to do the next two weeks but I think I will be able to release an early beta in October.</p>

                <title>What I learned during 10 years interviewing people - talking about hiring and discrimination</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>At the moment women in IT is one of the most discussed topics I am aware of. There is no day without new tweets, tumbles and other stuff discussing the topic. After I read Ashes post I thought about talking about it from the perspective of an employer and someone who had more hiring talks than you can count the last ten years.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>This post is basically a collection of things I learned from hiring and managing employees and contributors (read: freelancers).</p>

<p>I will briefly talk about my past experience and my hiring process before I start discussing gender diversity. So if you only care for that part just skip the next two sections.</p>

<p>I feel like I should add a big, fat disclaimer, but I refuse to write it in red. These are my experiences. I will not claim to have all the answers, not even one, I do not speak with an absolute authority. I just talk about what I did, how I did it, why I thought it would be a good idea and what I learned. It is possible that you disagree, which is good. Different situations, different people, different ways to handle something. The worst thing you can do after reading this is trying to adopt every single point and act like I did.</p>

<h2>How I learned the essentials</h2>

<p>Thankfully I did not have to learn everything by myself. My father taught me everything possible. He is self-employed as long as I can remember, working for international companies, my mother runs the organizational part of his business. I could always ask them for help and when they saw that I was about to screw up they told me what I was doing wrong when clients were about to be harmed - but otherwise I had to learn my own lessons by myself. And I am really thankful that they did not try preventing me from doing stupid things.</p>

<p>Thanks to my father I grew up with tech everywhere. It was his job and it became my passion. I could solder before being able to do more math than add, subtract, multiply and divide. With 13 I had the opportunity to join a group of people organizing network parties. We had up to 350 gamers and after my first year I was in charge of the network and tournament organization. This was also the first time I had to coordinate and work with others, sometimes just telling them what to do - and I learned a lot.</p>

<p>With 16 I founded my company to be able to charge people for repairing their stuff. Thanks to the fact that I was well known I had the chance to work for small companies. I think my biggest client had around 50 employees. As I turned 18 I started a training as financial consultant, while finishing my university-entrance diploma. I chose to be self employed, learn in the evenings, take the exams for my training on weekends and run two businesses side by side.</p>

<p>I took as many advanced trainings as I possibly could while working (they were offered on a regular basis). I focused on the psychological part of selling, hiring and managing and became an IT coach for around 250 people. This is the part where I stop, because I would waste the next five minutes of your and my life with details that do not really matter, but would explain how everything in this organization fits together. Just to finish this up: This is the business I only manage today, it does not consume much time, my employees basically do everything by themselves, I only make sure the quality is as good as it can be. 90% of my time are used for freelancing, developing and designing things for the web or iOS.</p>

<h2>The hiring process</h2>

<p>Being responsible for other people was a bit scary at the beginning but I quickly noticed that there are some projects where I needed help. Sometimes to stick to the schedule, sometimes to ensure the quality was right.</p>

<p>It was before my 17th birthday that I needed to hire someone. A client asked me to setup 30 workstations, two servers and the network. I asked two friends who I knew from network parties. We agreed on a price and just did it. There was no need for anything but "Do you have time and want to make some money?". I knew them, I knew they can do what was needed.</p>

<p>For my second company I needed some people for growth. I could not satisfy the demand on my own and I wanted to make sure the business still runs when I am not there.</p>

<p>In eight years I interviewed around 300 people, for myself, clients and friends. Believe me one thing: You will see and hear things you never wanted to see or hear. But my top 3 "Oh my god, just go away!" moments are a topic for another post.</p>

<p>I always used a pretty simple interview process. The first question, after I told them what they would have to do, was "Do you believe you are able to do this in a professional way, making sure the quality is excellent?".</p>

<p>If the response is: "Yes I can", it is the point where I would start asking domain specific questions. What I ask depends on what I expect. Highly specialized vs. an all-round talent. Sometimes I ask a specialist I know to attend for the domain specific questions. If customer contact is involved I add questions how he would handle them. Of course, past projects are also interesting. I think you know the different possibilities how to interview someone.</p>

<p>If the candidate response is "I am not sure", the first question is "What do you think would it need that you are able to do it?", followed by "Are you willing to do this to get the job?". There are trial periods, there are time based contracts, there are so many possible ways to see if a candidate is able to learn what he needs. This does not work if you need someone immediately but for the long run I also always consider people who are able to learn.</p>

<p>After the interview I consider the candidate. A standard procedure would be a one week contract, paid, of course, working with the team if there is already one. I do not believe that hiring someone without trial and forcing people who just hate each other on plain sight to work together is a good idea.</p>

<h2>Discrimination and sexism</h2>

<p>I know that women are often paid significantly less than men. I am aware that there is discrimination based on gender, skin color, sexual orientation, religious and political views, and everything else you can think of.</p>

<p>I had one contractor who thought it would be funny to always make the same joke about an interview process involving the cup size of a women. The first time I told him that it is not appropriate, the second time was the last time he was ever seen in my office and company.</p>

<p>I have to admit I do not know how it feels to be discriminated, well - beside jokes I had to take as kid because I was a bit bulky. But I also do not see why we cannot solve this. I sometimes have a really simple black and white view of things.</p>

<p>Inappropriate behavior of any kind should be mentioned in a civilized way and from this point the person should know not to do it anymore. How hard can that be? Millions of years of evolution and still some people claiming to be intelligent are not able to understand someone finds something offensive? Sorry, I just do not get it.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is not obvious if someone feels offended by a certain behavior. Telling this person, the first time it happens, should result in a changed behavior and no hard feelings for calling it out. You know, this stuff called civilized communication. Funny stuff, maybe one day we will all just use it.</p>

<h2>Who do I hire? What are the consequences?</h2>

<p>So, when hiring I look out for three main qualities:
Is the candidate able to deliver, gets the job done and works with the rest of the team? If my interview partner is capable of doing all of this, it's likely that I consider him as an option. I never wanted many employees, as a consequence I always just worked with the necessary minimum plus contractors. Worked exceptionally well for me. But I believe this is business and industry specific.</p>

<p>While asked to help interviewing a candidate for other companies I had not always have a choice who was in front of me, so I will only talk about the people I hired for my two businesses, so I talk about IT and finance, both fields which are, I believe, male dominated.</p>

<p>The ratio of applications from men to women was 5 : 1, sometimes even 10 : 1. The women I interviewed had one thing in common: Most of them were qualified for the position, those who were not were less likely to say: "Yes, I can just learn this, no problem", while I believe around 30-40% of the male candidates lacked some skills but believed they could easily learn them.</p>

<p>Over the years I hired 7 men and 4 women for my own businesses. They were between 20 and 55 when they started, white and colored. I know one of them is gay and one a believing muslim.
The best advice I can give you: diversity is great. Different perspectives, different experiences and knowledge. I did not find a downside. It is a bit more management work, but I do not see this as a problem.</p>

<p>Before the hiring process a salary or rate and bonuses are decided, according to required skills/time etc. Then candidates are interviewed. The problem with this is that there is no room for negotiations and sometimes this is just bad. But on the other hand it easily ensures everyone is treated equally. There is no difference if someone just screwed up or acted out of the way or if I like the person. Salary is the same and bonuses are depending on a work target. Pretty simple. Both industries do not favor anything but skills, this makes this system pretty simple and easy to implement.</p>

<h3>Edge cases</h3>

<p>Several things have to be considered when you have a diverse team. When we have a short meeting I get some cookies and gummy bears. Knowing that one of my employees is muslim means I have to check that he is allowed to eat them, which means gummy bears which do not contain animal starch, etc. Not too hard. I do not really see this as such a big problem as some people claim. Again, millions of years of evolution. We have a brain to use it. Being sure not to exclude someone with such simple things <em>is</em> important.</p>

<p>Some of them have kids. From my experience a women is more likely to take care of a child than a man. Maybe the school is calling or there was an accident or the child gets sick. It could be possible that a women misses two or three days a year because of this. Does it make her less qualified? Is her productivity lower? Work worse? Let me make it short because I never understood this discussions: No. </p>

<p>One of the funniest scenes I remember was a male employee bringing his kid to a six eyes meeting because he could not find a baby sitter. Pretty simple trick: Place a good-natured dog in front of a kid. Problem solved. Did you ever see a kid putting his pacifier in the mouth of a (obviously confused) dog? </p>

<p>30 Minutes later we had discussed everything we needed to continue working on the project, the kid was happy, the dog did not need much attention for the rest of the day and the employee was happy that this problem was solved this way, without drama, discussions, threat or anything else he encountered.</p>

<p>This will not work if there is a big meeting with many people. Especially if there are some who just do not like each other. Or if clients are involved. But as long as we can have a relaxed atmosphere why should I care? Work was done. And it should also be clear that it is an exception. The good thing about a team which likes and respects each other? You do not have to point this out and no one is offended.</p>

<h2>Training new employees</h2>

<p>I trained new employees for another company, overall something around 180, for nearly 4 years. Beside some special events we talk about 12 weeks, one evening a week. (I also trained two people for my business but I believe this is a less significant sum to take a resume.) They had to take an exam after those 12 weeks.</p>

<p>I would have to look up the exact numbers but I would guess around 140 men to 40 women. I have never seen one women fail, while it was common that at least one or two men do not pass. While the course was running the female attendees always worked as you expect it from someone who is professional while male attendees had a tendency to just scream an answer or question in the room or talk to someone else. On two occasions I had to ask two male attendees to leave the room. </p>

<p>Each course had ten to twelve attendees, sometimes they worked as a group. One advice if you ever find yourself in a position where I am your trainer: If you try to flirt with someone who obviously has no interest and clearly shows this, if you get more aggressive or if you generally act out of line with stupid (discriminating, sexist...) jokes, you will leave. You want to be treated as an adult, professional? Act this way and not like a hormone controlled 16 year old.</p>

<h2>How do I work?</h2>

<p>When I was 13 I first read "the hacker manifesto". It correlated with the way I was raised. Maybe this is one of the reasons I liked it so much back then.</p>

<p>I think I was 15 when I had the opportunity to attend some CS classes in an university as guest in my summer holidays. I was sitting in a lounge, trying to understand binary search trees. Someone a friend introduced me to, showed up and asked what I was doing. She wasted her two free hours explaining me the basics on how to implement a B-Tree. The first person explaining something advanced IT related to me (in person) was a woman. I could not have cared less about her gender - there was a person who taught me cool stuff. This was everything that mattered to me. Please do not get me wrong, I also like to see a beautiful women, bonus if she is fscking smart, but this should never influence work.</p>

<p>I judge people on what they do. I could not care less about skin color, sexual orientation or whatever. I want the highest possible quality of work and happy clients and I expect from everyone working with me the same.</p>

<p>I canceled contracts with freelancers and clients because I refuse to work with people who repeatedly believe stupid jokes are funny and do not care if they got told that some people in the room are offended. It does not make a difference for me if I am offended or someone else. I want a pleasant working environment for me, my employees and everyone else in the room.</p>

<h2>You are free to disagree, but...</h2>

<p>You are free to disagree with everything I wrote. You can disagree with the way I hire, you can disagree with the way I handle my team. Is it possible that 10 years are not enough experience? Is it possible that I am too young to see why we cannot just act like tolerant, sane adults? Maybe. Maybe I will see some things different in 10 years from now on. But right know it works just fine. I make a good living, I enjoy every hour of work I do and I can believe I do everything I can to not be part of the problem.</p>

<p>I am not free of guilt. Sometimes I just do not see a problem until someone points it out, sometimes I say something stupid without thinking of every possible interpretation. But I care wether or not someone is offended, I adjust and I try not to repeat mistakes.</p>

<p>I do not have all the answers. I do not know how to solve the big problem. But I do know one thing: Even if you disagree with me, if you just make sure you are not a part of the problem (and even do something against it if possible), then you do not have to become an activist, and still we will see the problem getting smaller. It will not vanish this way, but it will help those who fight it.</p>

                <title>Digital Ocean - good intensions, bad execution</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>Digital Ocean offers cloud servers with SSD storage. Sounds great, right? They also try to be active on many social media channels and sites like Hacker News. They answer support tickets pretty quickly. But I am still not sure if I really want to give them my credit card number. Let me explain what happened.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>If you use the Internet for more than two months you have likely seen many complains about anything. You learn to filter most of them. Sometimes you only get one side of the story, sometimes critical parts are missing, sometimes something just went wrong and people expect companies to never ever make a mistake. But what if a company admits and tries to solve a problem and just makes things worse?</p>

<p>Some time ago <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> wrote a post which made it to the front page of HN that they now offer servers with SSDs. SSDs always sound good, right? But I never heard of them so I browsed around the site.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed was the offering of "unlimited bandwidth". This is a nice thought but I think we all know this cannot work. Either there are strings attached or they go out of service or cancel your account. After browsing the site I read the comments thread on HN and I was not the only one who thought there is something wrong with this statement.</p>

<p>They were offering a free test node and I thought about a UK and US based vServer so I wanted to give them a try. Maybe AWS micro, Linode and others are not the only option. The small server are potent enough for my needs. I registered and account but before I could spin up an instance I had to attend a client meeting.</p>

<p>In the evening I logged in and wanted to start a server.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your account hast been suspended.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why?! I did <em>nothing</em>. Maybe the initial offering with test servers and the fact that it was on HN was too much for them. First thing: Back to the HN thread. I found the limitation of the trial account on HN, not on their site. Three hours after you signed up. Seriously? You are kidding, right? A three hour trial after someone hits "Sign up" is nearly as worthless as no trial period, if not worse, if there is no hint how the trial works.</p>

<p>I wrote a support ticket and got a response that the three hours are common and that I will receive a credit for $1.25. But I would first have to give them my credit card number to get the credit. And they would authorize $1.23. On HN they commented this would be a limitation of the accounting software. </p>

<p>Looking at the site today they changed the bandwidth part. So they really try to learn from mistakes and improve. This is the good part. But do I want to give my credit card to a company trying to sell me a cloud product which cannot get an accounting software to work the way they want and are obviously not really good in communicating essential parts of their product? Especially a test period which is unbelievable stupid? "Create a free account" equals "your test period starts now, no matter what you do".</p>

<p>They are really communicative, especially with automatically generated mails. Sadly they all went to the spam folder - which I, and this is something which is 100% my fault, do not check regularly. I was also not used to have one. But Outlook.com is another story.</p>

<p><img src="digital-ocean.png" alt="Spam folder, full of Digital Ocean mails" /></p>

<p>Etel from their support team reacted fast, delivered a solution and was really friendly. But this will not change the fact that everything else just smells bad for me. I now have around $22 promo code credits in my account and <em>still</em> cannot test a droplet because I did not give them my credit card to test a service which currently should cost me nothing. And I cannot see how much credits I really have. After adding the promo code I only have seen a "added!" message. No way to check my current credits or see if they were really added to my account.</p>

<p>From what I can tell the product is great, the company fast in working through support tickets, friendly, solution oriented, but they cannot work around internal limitations. They are in a market which has some serious competition. AWS does not get more expensive, Hetzner and Linode are already cheap. They have a solid product but I still have a bad feeling about giving away informations which they could use to take money from me.</p>

<p>If you do not mind giving away credit card informations, are looking for a cheap host which seems to perform really good, get one of the promo codes they toss around and give them a try. I had the chance to see a friend doing a load test and the instance performed really good. Maybe I am just a bit too quirky when it comes to credit card informations, maybe I am just spoiled from Hetzner. But even if I am currently not their biggest fan they seem to deliver and treat customers well.</p>

                <link></link>
                <description><p>There are two types of online service you can use. On one you are the customer on the other you are the product. Lately, thanks to Instagram, there has been a lot of discussion if it is okay to provide a service to people just to sell their informations. Is this a valid business model? Is it the only business model which could work.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Before we continue, you should read this <a href="http://xkcd.com/1150/">XKCD comic</a> about Instagram. As I already said on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4952378">Hacker News</a> this comparison is IMHO not suitable. But let us start from the beginning.</p>

<p>I think we do not have to talk a lot about the different service models, we are all familiar with both of them. A direct competition for example is Twitter and App.net. On Twitter you are the product, on App.net you are a customer. As most of you know I am not the biggest fan of Twitter (I still use it, though). Some of their recent moves are IMHO a direct result of the fact that they still found no way to make a sustainable business with what they have. But why do I not just move to App.net?</p>

<p>Because sometimes it is okay to be the product. We are basically talking about your choice if you use service A, you are the customer, or B, you are the product.</p>

<h2>Are you willing to pay?</h2>

<p>The first question you have to ask yourself is if you are willing to pay for said service. You cannot get a service for free and believe developers and servers are paid by magical unicorns that shit money. I am not really sure what people expect when they get something for free. Did their parents not teach them not to take candy from the strange looking old man pointing to his minivan?</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes you get stuff for free with no strings attached, but this is mostly good will or a strategy to sell related services, features, whatever. If there is no obvious way how a company is making money you are likely seeing a "service B" type company.</p>

<p>If you are not willing to pay you have two options: be the product or do not use the service at all.</p>

<h2>What can happen if you are the product?</h2>

<p>This is a tricky question because it depends on you. I know this sucks, taking responsibility for your own actions and stuff. I cannot believe I even suggest this in the modern age. But let us imagine, for one second, that we were all brought up to be intelligent adults.</p>

<p>We are aware of the fact that we are dealing with a company of type B. We are the product. Here comes a really crazy thought. We just put informations up we do not care about if they are sold.</p>

<p>If Instagram can make a business model out of selling pictures of my fianceés cat, my morning coffee and some places I attend this is fine. I am not willing to pay for the service and they sell something I do not care about if it is sold.</p>

<p>What if Facebook sold my phone number to telephone marketers? I would hate that. I do not like being cold called. But wait - here is the tricky part: They do not have my number because I never uploaded it. Shocking, right? I do care about this piece of information, so I keep it as private as I think it is necessary.</p>

<p>This is a pretty old rule we all know. Only upload informations you are willing to share with the world. Each system has bugs, every company can change, everyone can once mess up privacy settings while adding someone to the "screw this guy" group.</p>

<h2>"But there are no alternatives!"</h2>

<p>This is my favorite argument. Show me one service your life depends on, which only exists because it is selling <em>all</em> your private informations. Sorry, but you are not forced to use anything the Internet has to offer. Joking aside, I know, in reality, we want to use those fancy services to stay in touch with people or get the latest news in real time.</p>

<p>If there is really no alternative of service type A you can still get an account on evil service B. Just do not upload anything. If you fear someone would sell your spam email account together with your name you really should not use anything which requires registration. As long as you upload nothing what can happen? They could try to track your surf behavior and show you related adds. Just use stealth mode and log out of the service.</p>

<p>If you start sharing informations or just engage in conversations - what exactly can happen? They could read them, sell them, most likely automatically search for keywords and show you ads. Even if they sell your complete conversation history: Just do not share nuclear weapon codes over Facebook. In the real world no one cares if you just invited five friends over to dinner.</p>

<h2>Uptopia</h2>

<p>Of course, I would love to see a world with free services for everyone. Services which can be used to do "the right" or "good" things. I think you know the examples - how reports or freedom fighters use those services to show cruel dictatorship and so on. Services where you own your data. Where you are free to post - as long as it is neither inhuman or illegal - whatever you want without fearing consequences from society, employers or governments.</p>

<p>But this is utopia. In the world we live in we can only get such a service if the company behind it can actually pay the bills and satisfy laws and regulations.</p>

<p>Let us imagine App.net would be this company. A company of type A. We all get an account, abandon Twitter and enjoy our life. What happens to those, who cannot pay $5 but have something important to say to the rest of the world? Should everyone else pay $50 to compensate them?</p>

<p>As a company which wants to open up for <em>everyone</em> you need a business model which either depends on some people paying for others or you start making money in a non traditional way. What do you think, which one is likelier to work out?</p>

<h2>I am a happy, little product!</h2>

<p>There are two easy rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only upload what you are willing to share with the whole world</li>
<li>If you do not pay for the service you are the product</li>
</ul>

<p>Free services have informations and data from me. And I'd like to repeat that I have no problem if they start selling it. It is not like the XKCD comic where I lose something. I still have my data. It is not gone. My images will not vanish from my phone and hard drive because Instagram sells them. The only result is a company making money, providing me a service I like and I am not willing to pay for, for free. Everyone wins.</p>

                <title>Week 1 - what happened?</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>I thought a bit about my blog and how blogging changed the last years. One thing I will try to bring back is a short overview what happened the whole week, what was interesting, what was new and what I did. I think this will also be a good way to rant about new projects.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Do you remember the times when you, mostly on Fridays, read link lists and other stuff people posted as weekly recap? It will not be something like this. Promise. There is also no need to bring this back. We have Twitter and other social networks. We can share this stuff in real time. Wasting the time of my readers with repeated URL spam is not something I want to do, especially since they are preserved in my <a href="http://notes.screamingatmyscreen.com">Tumbler account</a>.</p>

<h2>Editors</h2>

<p>I did not have much time writing code the last two weeks. Most of the time we had guests which means I could not get some hours of distraction free time. But I had some time to think about my development setup. Part of this will be a reason for another post. But what I noticed: Starting vim, after all those years, still feels like coming home. I do most of my work in Sublime Text 2 but a short <code>mvim ~/code/drupan</code> makes me want to add some plugins and start using it again. But sadly I always run into the same shortcomings. It is still ugly, I am looking at you NERDTree. Command-T and other plugins are still not as good as ST2s integrated solution. Those are just the two biggest problems I currently have.</p>

<p>I also find the lint-plugin quite useful but configuring this with vim and syntastic seems to involve the blood of a virgin, scarifying a goat and summoning some demons. </p>

<p>I do not need much from my editor. Syntax highlighting, sane indenting, Command-T and it should look nice. I refuse to use something that is ugly for hours and hours.</p>

<p>I tried ChocholatApp again. Somehow they managed to really fuck up. If I edit a CSS file and start writing a comment with <code>/*</code> all keystrokes are doubled and I cannot delete anything anymore. I am not sure if I run in some obscure keyboard shortcut because I am using a German layout or if there is just a bug. But looking good does not help if it is broken. And the integrated Command-T is just a joke.</p>

<p>Maybe I will give PeepOpen a chance and pay some $. If vim + PeepOpen work I would have nearly everything I could ask for.</p>

<h2>PEP8</h2>

<p>I am saying this, knowing that someone will flame me like I just killed a kitten: F<em>*</em> PEP8. I know why it was written, I always stuck to the rules. But I decided to break one of them. The most defended and discussed one. I will not limit my code-lines to 80 characters.</p>

<p>My biggest problem is that it is nearly impossible to write Django models without violating this rule. I could break lines but this just makes my code ugly. Ugly code is not the goal but it is inevitable if you write model files with an 80 character limit. Also if I write sentences that explain a command line argument e.x.. It is just a sentence and it will not make the code unreadable. But it will help making it look nicer and make scanning through the essential part faster.</p>

<h2>catntent</h2>

<p>What happens if you put three people in a room thinking about a name for a content management system? Right - cats in a tent. Could be a cute logo, right? And I thought playing World of Warcraft while finding a name was a stupid idea after I started blogging with a software which is called <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/drupan/">drunken panda</a>.</p>

<p>catntent is the CMS powering my companies homepage. I am currently working on it to release it under the BSD license.</p>

<p>I am using Django and separating most applications - this way you pick what you need, add it to a project, write your template or extend the apps. Most Django based systems I know brake with the app principle, force everything in one folder structure (mostly breaking down things like models, views, custom model managers…) you have to study and integrate everything so tightly that it is nearly impossible to replace parts of it.</p>

<h2>New Years Resolution</h2>

<p>There simply are none. I do not need a new year to change things. I do not wait till a certain point in time to try to improve. I just start doing it as fast as I can and see a reason to. Just as a short clarification since some people asked.</p>

<h2>Next Week</h2>

<p>I currently have three posts waiting to be published. I fear @sternenkind getting sick of reading my ramblings and trying to make some sentences suck less. I should also update my portfolio and if I find some time rework the about section of this site. I wish you a great week :)</p>

                <title>The Cloud vs. Dedicated Servers</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>I used a lot of my time the last two weeks to work on the hosting option for <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/drupan">drupan</a> powered sites. While splitting up tasks in services I thought about all the possibilities how I could host them. I looked at AWS, Heroku, Rackspace and considered renting some dedicated servers from Hetzner. To be honest I am surprised by the outcome. I hope to give you a decent overview and maybe a bit help to decide what works for you if you are in a similar situation.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Just as a quick introduction for those who do not know me: I like servers. Setup, scaling and administration is nothing I consider to be a necessary evil, but actually enjoy it from time to time. When I started organizing network parties with my old team I spent more time with game servers, the network and working on the tournament system than gaming. I think I know pretty well (after all those years) how to install a database, add ssh keys to a system and make sure the web server is up to date. So it would not be a problem to go the dedicated way. Of course there would be the point where I would need help from people who are specialized in database design / sharding / partitioning, etc - likely earlier than going the cloud hosting route.
I realize my strengths and weaknesses and I believe that I do not have to and cannot specialize in everything, so hiring if needed is a viable option for me.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Before you start looking at the different options you should know what you need. I need block storage. This means hosting only on Heroku would not be possible. I want to use a CDN for the static generated sites. This has two advantages.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the backend goes down or a hosting provider has problems customer domains are still online.</li>
<li>Performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The load on systems is currently unpredictable. If 20 users generate their site at the same moment is a completely other beast than 2 users updating a site in the morning and evening.
There will also be an option to rent dedicated backends and frontends with a custom branding. Easy and fast provisioning is definitely a plus.</p>

<h2>Stability and Performance</h2>

<p>If you search for experiences with cloud providers you find as many opinions as people writing. The cloud is great, the cloud is bad. Moving to Heroku, moving away from Heroku. 100% uptime to "crashes if I run <code>uptime</code>". From some points on earth one CDN is faster than another and so on.</p>

<p>There are some things you should always remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>the cloud does not mean you pay nothing and get all the performance a datacenter can offer</li>
<li>you will have downtimes</li>
<li>it is easier to minimize downtime </li>
<li>it is faster to get processing power, storage or memory if you need it</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall it is easier to react to problems, needs and give various options a try and see how it performs in testing or production if you choose a cloud provider. At least if you do not want to buy systems "just in case, if you are lucky, and if the stars align right,…" you could need.</p>

<h2>Amazon Web Services</h2>

<p>If I would have to describe AWS in one sentence it would be: "You get everything you dream of and pay for everything they can measure." It is really that easy. Need a task queue? SQS. Payment processing? FPS. Block storage? EBS. And the list goes on and on. As I said you pay for everything. IOPS, Traffic, requests - you can measure it? You pay for it. I actually prefer this to a certain point. If I pay for the resources I use they make money. If they make money they are less likely to go out of business.</p>

<p>While visiting an AWS event in Leipzig I had the chance to talk to some people. Now that I considered using AWS I send a mail with my open questions. Two days later everything was answered. I described what I wanted to do. The - I think - sales engineer answering my questions also commented on the possibilities and shortcomings and how to compensate them. The pre sales service was great.</p>

<p>Another thing I like is the fact that you get a free tier which you can actually use to test your idea. Of course micro instances are not the most powerful option the world has ever seen, 100000 SQS requests are just enough for two request every minute. Depending on your use case this can be enough. Or you have to pay $2.70 / month for a service which queries the queue every second. But over all you get a decent free package.</p>

<p>Before you can see or use anything you have to enter your credit card informations. They will not take your instance down, they charge you if you go over the free limit. You also cannot get any statistics how your next bill will look like. For me, this is not really pleasant.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You can get everything you need from one provider</li>
<li>Usable administration interface</li>
<li>Lots of different systems (High CPU, high memory,…)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You have to learn Amazons vocabulary. Always three letters, with the first one either standing for "simple" or "elastic".</li>
<li>Calculating your monthly costs is nearly impossible if you do not have usage statistics before moving to AWS.</li>
<li>Not really cheap</li>
<li>Contact sales before buying - there are some limitations I could not directly find on the page / FaQ (maximum 100 buckets on S3 e.x.)</li>
<li>Look out for vendor lockin</li>
<li>IMHO bad documentation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Heroku</h2>

<p>Using Heroku somehow gave me a comfy feeling. They are just doing everything right. You can either use the web interface or a command line tool. You just push your repository and the magic happens. Not sure how something works? Clean and structured help and FaQs. You just do not see all the stuff you would have to do if you use your own server.</p>

<p>I cannot say how their pre sales support looks like because I did not need to contact them. A really good sign.</p>

<p>The pricing is reasonable and you get nearly everything for free to test stuff. Want a task queue? Choose from different providers who are happy to sell you a hosted RabbitMQ or a hosted Redis instance. Free options are not always sufficient for anything else than testing but this is fine for me. I can see if my applications still work when deployed, what else can you want?</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Open Source based services with a free tier</li>
<li>Reasonable pricing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No storage options. (If you do not need them great, else go for S3 e.x.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rackspace</h2>

<p>Rackspace offers servers, storage, a CDN, and other stuff just with a lot better pricing model than AWS. They have no equivalent for services like FPS e.x. but this is a really special case if you ask me. You do not have to pay for everything they can measure. The pricing structure is really clear and easy to follow.</p>

<p>They advertise their great support. My first experience was the live chat which did not work on OSX (Safari, no add ons) or my iPad and always faded over something, on every page, I wanted to read. But if you manage to reach someone they give you fast and clear answers.</p>

<p>Pricing is comparable to AWS. Sadly they offer no free tier. You have to pay to test if you would be comfortable working with them or if people will actually like what you do. But beside that it is a really good option. Looking at their CDN and the pricing it just beats S3 / Cloud Front. No requests or other stuff to consider. You pay for bandwidth and storage. Simple and easy pricing.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sane pricing model</li>
<li>Lots of different systems (High CPU, high memory,…)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No free tier</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dedicated Servers</h2>

<p>There is always the option to rent servers. You have to administrate them, compensate downtimes, plan for crashes and recovery and all the other stuff we know. If you already have a team doing this kind of work and have the money to buy more servers than you actually need (backup systems, spare systems if you have to scale…) this is a really viable option.</p>

<p>If you only want to write code and have no experience with system administration dedicated servers are no option for you. If you think you can just buy a box, put everything on it and see what happens you should not even think about this option.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Could be cheaper</li>
<li>Full control of your environment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Will likely be more expensive</li>
<li>More work</li>
<li>Slower provisioning</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overall Ranking</h2>

<p>While dedicated hosting is a two edged sword it could be a viable path if all the time and work you have to put into it are okay for you.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you do not need block storage or other stuff go for Heroku. They are doing a great job making your life as developer simple. </li>
<li>You need block storage or other features you do not get using Heroku? Rackspace. Better pricing model, it is that simple for me.</li>
<li>If you need a lot of different services beyond the stuff Heroku and Rackspace offers go for AWS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those three cloud providers offer different levels of services from "hosting your application" to "just tell us what you need, we have a three-letter-service offering exactly this, just be prepared to pay for everything you can imagine".</p>

<p>The difference between AWS and Rackspace are not that big. The most important point is the clear pricing model and the better documentation if you choose Rackspace.</p>

<h3>Combining Providers</h3>

<p>There is always the option to combine and mix different providers. Use Rackspace Files with your frontend on Heroku and your workers and storage on AWS for example. Depending on your preferences you could get the best out of all clouds. On the other hand it is, at least in my opinion, a disadvantage if you have to look in three different administration consoles, have three different bills and contact three different support teams if something goes wrong and you do not know what exactly happens.</p>

<p>To prevent a vendor lockin on AWS you can also use hosted services you would use if you go for Heroku. Most of them offer a free tier on their homepage. Or you just get a lot EC2 instances and start setting up your own services, although I do not recommend this. You have to do the whole sysops work and likely have to pay more than you would have to pay if you just go for the AWS service.</p>

<h3>Drupan-hosted</h3>

<p>I will likely use AWS and Rackspace. Payment is troublesome in Europe, Stripe is still not here, the free tier allows me to evaluate the service without taking a too big risk. The only thing I will use Rackspace for is their CDN offering. Just a lot more appealing than S3 and Cloud Front. Especially if you consider that you do not get statistics based on buckets and domains. Because of this shortcoming I would not be able to offer usage based pricing to my customers. I would have to assume x connections for every y GB transferred. Not really fair if you ask me.</p>

                <title>Selling Your Service Or Product - The Basics</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>Last week I was talking to 14 boys and girls about IT. Their school offered an orientation day and I was invited as a speaker. One of them was especially interested in selling products. Now this is something I wanted to talk about for a long time on my blog. Maybe you remember the <a href="/2012/5/time-to-talk-about-business/">"talk about business"</a> series?
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>I used to make a big part of my living as consultant for eight years. I had the opportunity to learn from great, international coaches and at the same time practice what I learned. The basic idea of selling and consulting is always the same - no matter if we talk about software or a vacuum cleaner. And still so many people (even big companies) do it horrible wrong. Of course really big companies get away with it most of the time, but this is due to other factors. For us it is interesting to know how we should market and sell our product or the service we just built.</p>

<h2>Marketing And Selling Is Important</h2>

<p>I know enough people who think sales persons or marketing departments are utterly useless. They believe a great product is enough. Most of the time those people are the ones who build fantastic applications, hardware or services. Sadly those are the same people who do not understand that not everyone is like them. If they see something new and think it could be interesting they give it a try. Other people just don't.</p>

<p>Customers do not want stunning websites with a lot of descriptions what a great product can do. They do not even care about the built-in cheese grater. They want someone who listens to their problems and tells them how they can fix it with this special product. Some tech-savvy, misanthropic assholes will be offended and disagree, but "humans need humans" was, is and will be a universal truth.</p>

<p>No matter how good your product is, if no one knows about it, if your competitors send someone with a demonstration device to potential customers or if people do not fully understand your product no one will buy it. Not even if it is the best one available.</p>

<h2>Know Your Product</h2>

<p>If you do not know the product you cannot sell it. It is really that easy. If your potential customers asks questions and you have no idea or have to call someone or read your own flyer - then you have a problem. There is nothing that makes selling harder to impossible than being caught off guard on basic questions.</p>

<p>This does not mean you have to know every little detail. You should know if your web service is able to send newsletters to customers. You do not have to know how to partition databases to scale it.</p>

<p>There is a difference between knowing a product and knowing every detail. On the one hand, you should know as much as possible - but on the other hand it's no shame to call your office and ask a developer if and how this special scenario could be realized. </p>

<p>If a client has some special needs and you talk to one of your developers before promising that it will work you have another advantage: Your client can be sure that you are not just some sales person promising pink ponies to land a deal. At least this is what clients believe. Developers know the software they build and what it is capable of, right?</p>

<h2>Know Your Contenders</h2>

<p>If you are selling a software as a service, for example, then you have to know your competitors. What if a potential client already is a customer of someone else? What if they ask you about the differences to evaluate which solutions fits their needs? You have to be able to answer those questions. But there is one thing you should not do:</p>

<p>Never start telling your potential customers why other products suck. Never ever.</p>

<p>I cannot stress this enough. If you are not explicitly asked about the differences, you talk about the strengths and advantages of your product. And if you are asked you talk about the strengths and advantages of your product.</p>

<p>I know some people will call me fanboy for this one but the example just works. Imagine an elderly women who wants to buy a smartphone. You tell her that the new Samsung Galaxy 7 has a 90" screen, 500 cores and 45 petabyte memory. 
I just give her an iPhone, tell her to type the number of her daughter, hit FaceTime and she can see her grandchild.</p>

<p>You can tell her that the iPhone has far inferior hardware. 
I can tell her how easy it is to use and that she can always call her daughter and see her grandchildren rise. I do not have to explain to her why the specs don't matter, manufacturing quality or anything else.</p>

<p>Some of you might now argue that this example is wrong because the Galaxy and "what if"… you get the point. This example sucks, but it's the best one I can come up with at the moment. Let us continue.</p>

<h3>If You Have A Bad Product</h3>

<p>You should be aware of the weaknesses of your product.
There is, most of the time, not only one product for a certain task and most of the time you have different trade offs if you choose one of the products over another.</p>

<p>But what do you do when your product is just bad? Cheap components, known problems, not matching any use case?</p>

<p>Stop selling it. If you sell crap people will notice at a certain point. Get another job.</p>

<p>There was a new client I visited for the first time. Coffee was prepared and it was just a matter of "What do you need?", "What makes sense for you?", questions and statements. 
How did I get this client? Another client recommended me. </p>

<p>The new client knew that I do not make promises I cannot fulfill and that I also admit if there are weaknesses in one of the products or scenarios where it is problematic. And still, I did not need to convince him that those products are still worth buying. I showed him how he can solve the problem he has with the product I have. Nothing more. </p>

<p>This appointment only went so smooth because a previous client recommended me. Not my product. Customers and clients sometimes care more about the people who sell something than about the actual product. This also means that you do not sell them something they do not need - or your reputation will suffer.</p>

<h2>Service Always Starts After You Sold</h2>

<p>Take care of problems. Call or email your new customer personally. Do not let your secretary handle everything. Know their birthday. Maybe, if it came up in a conversation, the birthdays of wife, husband or kids. Remember the dates and gratulate them personally.</p>

<p>This is one of the differences between selling something and building a client relationship. Be nice, keep your promises and from time to time just let him know you remember him without directly calling to sell something.</p>

<p>Maybe you have candy or other merchandise stuff with your company brand. Throw it away. Kids do not want company branded chocolate. They want an ordinary chocolate bar they know and like. Most of the time this branded stuff tastes awful, and no one needs yet another ruler.</p>

<p>Know what your client likes. Wine, Whisky or chocolate - get something that tastes good without your brand. These are birthday or Christmas gifts people remember. Especially if you have a present for their kids or even a snack for their pets. </p>

<h2>In A Nutshell</h2>

<p>These are only rough, not completely elaborated points about best practices. They can be a bit different depending on your country, on your product, your personality and your client.</p>

<p>But there are some things I consider to be a universal truth:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be honest</li>
<li>You have to sell to make money</li>
<li>Talk about strengths of your product</li>
<li>Treat other people with respect</li>
<li>Keep promises</li>
<li>Only sell if it makes sense for the customer</li>
<li>Don't sell garbage</li>
<li>Service starts after the deal is closed</li>
<li>A good reputation is essential</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot more to say about selling and marketing and I will likely take the time and talk about every point in its own post.</p>

<p>But if you now think: "Doh, of course! This is simple. No need to talk about this stuff!", ask yourself if every sales and support person you encountered in your life followed this easy and simple principles we should not even have to mention.</p>

<p>But now that the basics are clear we can talk about some more serious and in depth about those points.</p>

                <title>Django Beginner Series - Introduction</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>Some Twitter followers could already know that I am working on a book. Just not what it is about. Big announcement: It will be about web application development using Django. It is supposed to be an easy entry in the world of Django and tries to cover as much as possible in a simple way to get started with the framework.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>If you do not care why I am doing this skip to "ideas and how this blog is involved" to get an idea what tutorials I will post in the course of the next weeks.</p>

<p>Django is the best documented project I know. You can find nearly anything in the documentation and if you are not comfortable browsing it you can just read the code with comments. But there is something Django lacks. I know that not everyone agrees with me on this. But I also know how many people asked me basic things they could not figure out just from reading the tutorial. Django needs some basic introduction material.</p>

<p>I do not think it would be wise to rewrite the whole documentation. If I want to know something about a model field, how a battery works or just see if there is something I am missing about a problem the documentation is great. But it does not walk you through the process of creating a basic application that actually works. At least not good enough as it looks to me.</p>

<p>I am aware that there are great resources and that there is even a "community driven book". But this brings me to another point. There are nearly no books written in German about Django. I think I have seen one. Sometimes it only has a little paragraph, maybe a chapter in a book about Python but nothing serious. Other books, written in English, are just so outdated it hurts.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with Django and my company realizes projects based on it on a regular basis. I would love to see more people using Django and I think this could be a way to give something back to the project. A little thank you, spreading the word and showing the great possibilities and reasons why more people should consider using Django.</p>

<h2>Ideas And How This Blog Is Involved</h2>

<p>I know that I am not in the position to provide a solid English translation of the book directly after it is finished. Not without some help. And I am also not sure when I will find the time to translate it. So I had another idea.</p>

<p>In the book I will use examples that are supposed to help my readers with real world problems. We will build</p>

<ul>
<li>a basic content management system</li>
<li>some kind of wiki</li>
<li>a tumblelog</li>
<li>something that will remind you of Twitter</li>
</ul>

<p>Beside the basic idea how to start such projects I can introduce management commands, migrations, templating, user accounts and profiles, project layout and structure and other stuff without boring everyone to death.</p>

<p>To reach more people I will link the examples in this blog and add tutorials how everything is put together.</p>

<p>The four "big projects" are currently only ideas. I am still looking for some input what I should include and what I should leave out of the tutorials. The goal is pretty simple: "Introduce enough features so everyone has a basic understanding how Django works and hopefully will be able to realize any project with the help of the documentation". I refuse to copy big parts of the docs, this would make the whole project pointless.</p>

<p>If you have any ideas, wishes or comments send me a <a href="mailto:timo@screamingatmyscreen.com">mail</a>, comment on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4749368">Hacker News</a> or send me a <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fallenhitokiri">tweet</a>.</p>

                <title>The iPad Mini Is Not For You</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>Yesterday Apple introduced the iPad mini. As always I had two different types of people in my Twitter timeline. Those who tried to order it before the keynote was finished and those who explained why the iPad mini is a big disappointment. I believe it is great, just not for "us".
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>With "us" I mean me and likely everyone who is reading this blog. There are some exceptions, of course. Those who want a small eBook reader without sacrifycing the features of an iPad will be happy with the iPad mini. Everyone else will stick to the iPad as we know it.</p>

<h2>iPad mini As eBook Reader</h2>

<p>I recently started using my iPad to read a book. First I was not sure if I like a display in front of me or if it will be comfortable enough. I've been reading books for some years now and I am just used to those paper things. It works. Always. They are never low on battery, never required a charger, are instantly on, I do not have to update them and can always read them, not only in areas where books are "allowed". But I thought I should give eBooks a fair chance.</p>

<p>Three days later I am convinced that I will stick to it. It is easier to handle, I do not have to find a light source (I read in my bed most of the time) and, even if it is a lot of fun, I do not have to visit a book store if I do not want to. I also trust Apple to not pull an <a href="http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/">Amazon</a> on me.</p>

<p>But since I am not one of the biggest book lovers on earth I talked to my spouse. She basically owns more books than every library I know and still believes it is not enough. Books are her shoes. She explained to me that the iPad is nice but a bit too big for her liking to effectively replace a book. So the iPad mini would be ideal for her to replace books - only talking about size and weight, not the fact that some part of her is a little book snob and likely will never joining the digital gang.</p>

<h3>No Retina Display</h3>

<p>I do not see the lack of a retina display as bad. I still use my iPad first generation to read books. Of course a retina display is nice. But as long as you do not directly compare both displays to each other, the first generation iPad is still fairly good for reading.</p>

<p>Now the iPad mini has the same resolution on a smaller display. PPI are nearer to the retina display, even if still not there. We have to wait till someone actually uses the device to know if it is "near enough".</p>

<h2>Features, Specs and Quality</h2>

<p>I had a short <a href="https://twitter.com/fallenhitokiri/status/260836338230775808">tweet-exchange</a> with Jeff Croft. He is not really a big fan of the specs. There is no point in arguing, he is right.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-in-reply-to="260831959926841344"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/fallenhitokiri">fallenhitokiri</a> Totally agree. More than happy to pay a premium for high-end build quality. A 65% premium AND a shitty screen, tho? Too much</p>&mdash; Jeff Croft (@jcroft) <a href="https://twitter.com/jcroft/status/260832245034647552" data-datetime="2012-10-23T19:57:07+00:00">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This little piece of tech is not bleeding edge. It does not have a retina display. It is not the fastest tablet the world has ever seen. It is small. It is a full featured iOS device. It is cheap compared to its "big brothers". It is a device you buy if you want iOS and not pay half a monthly income.</p>

<p>But the big difference to other tablets or eBook readers is iOS. I cannot stress this enough. Full featured iOS device for ~$300. If you really only want to read eBooks you have to decide if you want <a href="http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/">Amazon DRM</a> or Apple. Hard decision when you can go for Apple and get both services and some more iOS magic.</p>

<p>What is not questionable is the iPad mini vs all other Android devices around $200-$300. I want quality. Not plastic. It is that easy. Most cheap tablets I hold in my hands so far were… cheap. You notice it when you hold them, when you touch them and when you type on them.</p>

<h2>Target Group</h2>

<p>Even if the specs are not premium the overall quality still is. And this is another big selling point. You get Apple quality and software for a low entry price.</p>

<p>Most people I have seen being disappointed by the iPad mini are tech-savvy. They know what a CPU is, they know what a retina display is and they do more than just reading a mail and a book or sometimes visiting a homepage to see if their favorite sports team won.</p>

<p>You can consider the iPad mini an gateway drug. You want iOS and Apple quality but you are still not sold on it. Now you do not discuss if you can spare &gt; $500. You think about $300. It makes a big difference.</p>

<p>If you take away all the tech stuff we all love (and just look at use cases and money you have to spend to get a device which is capable of fulfilling your needs) the iPad mini magically appears to make sense.</p>

<h2>I Am Not Disappointed</h2>

<p>But I still will not buy it. I do not have to optimize applications for another display resolution, I am comfortable with a bigger screen and I want retina. It is easy. The big one.</p>

<p>My parents on the other hand just read some mails, sometimes visit a sports site, look at a power point presentation or FaceTime with me. Do they need all those fancy features, specs and power? No.</p>

<p>Maybe Kenneth Reitz is right, at least it could be possible and I see a chance that this will happen.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>If the iPad Mini launches today at $300 or less, I fully expect it to replace desktop computers for 90% of my family members.</p>&mdash; Kenneth Reitz (@kennethreitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/kennethreitz/status/260734427531984896" data-datetime="2012-10-23T13:28:26+00:00">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Let us be honest. Most people do not need a computer. They need an email client and a browser on a device they cannot break or mess up. Overall quality and usability are more important than specs.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The iPad mini is great for people who do not care about specs, want a tool for a limited range of certain tasks and are not willing to pay a lot of money to get a device for trivial things which has features they do not care about.
Everyone else will stick to its bigger brothers.</p>

                <title>Zenbo, Zenbo As A Service And Pricing</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>After a week of working on Zenbo (and desperately searching for a new name, as this one is already protected by someone else) there are some news I want to share with you. Sadly not everything worked as expected and there were some private issues I had to take care of. But the good news are that I am on a good track for a release. Let me give you an overview what happened and what you can expect.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>First of all there were some major commits and pushes to the <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/Zenbo">GitHub repository</a>. Some changes that look small but make a lot of sense if you take the greater picture into consideration.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Each plugin will now ship with a default configuration. This means that you can, if you are happy with the defaults, run with a configuration file that only consists of three lines. A major step for people starting to use Zenbo.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are some things left to do. There will be a way to run Zenbo with defaults and command line arguments. This is needed for the hosting.</p>

<h3>Plugins</h3>

<p>There are no categories for plugins anymore. There is just a plugin with a <code>run</code> method in a class called <code>Feature</code>. The order in which plugins are executed is determinate by the order in which they are listed in the configuration file.</p>

<p>This makes it easy to add a base class for common features which will happen at one point. This way configuration handling will be provided by Zenbo and not be the job of every plugin and plugin author.</p>

<h3>Usability</h3>

<p>Today I started working on a way to setup a new site with <code>zenbo --init</code>. It is still a bit rough around the edges but I think it will be done tomorrow. The goal is making it easy for people without prior Zenbo experience getting a site up and running with one command. Deployment excluded.</p>

<h2>Zenbo As A Service</h2>

<p>I talked about <a href="http://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/2012/9/23/updates_on_zenbo_and_zenbo-hosted.html">zenbo-hosted</a>. Some people asked why we need another hosting and blogging service. The answer is pretty easy. I want it for my own and my companies projects.</p>

<p>Most of the time there is no reason for full featured content management systems and there is also no reason to waste money of clients for server resources and hosting they do not really need. With Zenbo as a service there is a way to edit sites in the browser and still benefit from the advantages of a static generated site.</p>

<p>Everyone who prefers a fast and easy to use hosting service, who wants to edit files locally and test a site before it goes live, designers who love the freedom doing what they want, not being tied to the annoyances and limitations of a CMS, everyone who loves git and vim will hopefully enjoy it.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>

<p>There will be a longer post how everything will work but a quick overview.</p>

<p>The backend will be hosted on a dedicated server. Adding content, no matter if you push with git or add it through the web interface will cause a commit in the git repository which will trigger a hook that starts generating your site.</p>

<p>Between the generation and the repository will be Celery which will make sure the same site is not generated multiple times parallel, that there are not 500 processes fighting over system resources and finally notify the front end if everything is fine or if problems occurred. My last tests indicate that generating 100 sites parallel should be fine on a small box. And thanks to some revised design decisions it will be easy to just add more or bigger boxes.</p>

<p>The final site will be hosted on S3. This will add a hughe performance boost over one or two server and cut down costs. If a customer still wants more performance I will offer a CloudFront add-on. This is, at least for my current knowledge, the fastest possible site you can have. No backend wasting time on generating content, servers near every customer visiting your site, in one word: performance.</p>

<h3>Pricing</h3>

<p>Now that I had some time evaluating my options I decided what the pricing will look like. Thanks to an Amazon Web Services event in Leipzig I had the opportunity to talk to some people and answer some open questions.</p>

<p>Zenbo-hosted will be free for everything which is non-commercial. There will be some strings attached to it. Those are still a topic that has to be discussed.</p>

<ul>
<li>private sites will always be free</li>
<li>no advertisement, or anything else</li>
<li>no file hosting</li>
<li>non-profit organizations have special rules</li>
</ul>

<h3>File Hosting</h3>

<p>This is just a matter of costs. I want to keep the service free with no strings attached for private usage. Putting up a 2MB PDF with your résumé is fine. Images and image galleries are fine. Uploading the last season of Buffy you just ripped for your friends is not cool. Not only because of the costs but also because of all the DMCA stuff I would have to answer.</p>

<h3>Non-profit Organizations</h3>

<p>Most of the time they cause some decent traffic and have some money at their hands for organizational costs. The only thing that changes is that they are halt to put "powered by Zenbo-hosted" in the footer of the site.</p>

<p>If a non-profit organization decides to use Zenbo I hope they will get in touch with me. I would be happy to support them and provide add-on packages as a donation.</p>

<h3>Companies</h3>

<p>Basically pretty easy. $5 / month as basic plan and you pay what you use. That is it. Without any add-ons this is everything you have to pay for.</p>

<h3>Add-Ons</h3>

<p>There will be several add-on packages you can order which will be a paid service. I am not sure if they will be all available at the beginning but they should appear in the course of this year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Post by mail</li>
<li>Hosting files</li>
<li>Dedicated backend</li>
<li>Mail service</li>
<li>API to submit any form you put on your site</li>
<li>Custom plugins</li>
<li>Domain service / DNS</li>
<li>AWS CloudFront support</li>
</ul>

<p>Beside the file hosting all features will be around $1 to $3 a month. I think this is reasonable and affordable.</p>

<h2>Why Am I Building This?</h2>

<p>Because I believe people will enjoy using it. Because I want to offer a different approach to classic hosting services. Because it is fun. Because it will be beneficial for my company. Because I hope some people who did amazing stuff that helped me do my job and run my business will notice it and use it - my way of saying "thank you".</p>

<p>There are many reasons. For me, the most important ones are fun, saying "thank you" and providing a solid base for future projects I and my company will be working on.</p>

                <title>Updates On Zenbo And Zenbo-hosted</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>After a week of doing nearly nothing, thanks to a really bad cold, I managed to get some testing and coding done. I thought I give you some updates how your favorite project is doing and how soon you will see the release of the last blogging platform you will ever need.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>This is one of the names and slogans that were suggested for Zenbo-hosted. While I liked this one, even if it maybe not 100% accurate, here are some more.</p>

<ul>
<li>yet another blogging platform</li>
<li>static blogging</li>
<li>scaled blogging</li>
<li>blogging with fun again</li>
</ul>

<p>I also thought about just using Zenbo. Name the service after the core software that is used. I had far worser ideas, believe me. The final decisions will be made in some weeks, so I am not really stressed making my mind up.</p>

<h3>Zenbo</h3>

<p>Today Zenbo learned what tags are and how they work. The documentation is not really finished but I did not find any bugs in the implementation so I just pushed it to the <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/Zenbo">repository on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>One of the main things I have to fix before the first release will be the way Zenbo reads and uses the configuration. A plugin should ship with sane defaults. Currently you have to add all configuration options to <code>config.yaml</code> which is not really comfortable, fast or clean.</p>

<p>Also it will be a lot easier to integrate Zenbo in zenbo-hosted if the configuration is internally represented as an object.</p>

<p>I think we will see the last beta version next week. After adding some more tests and finished the crawler everything should be ready for 1.0.0, except the documentation which is a different topic.</p>

<h3>Zenbo-hosted</h3>

<p>I have a basic implementation of the backend. Currently only working if the backend and web server are running on the same server. Separating the backend from the fronted needs some time. I am not sure if I will just use <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.4.3/index.html">Fabric</a> or integrate SSH to run commands on a remote system. Fabric seems to be the better way.</p>

<p>Adding multiple fronted servers on the other hand is already integrated. To be honest I am just to lazy to change the database scheme, even if it is quiet easy thanks to <a href="http://south.aeracode.org">South</a>.</p>

<p>I am also not happy with the way I create git repositories. I subprocess too much for my taste but finding a python git library that does not suck is not as easy as it sounds.</p>

<p>Pricing is also nearly set. Free for non-commercial use. I am not sure how to price companies but I thought about something like 10k requests / $x. Not sure what x needs to be to make this service sustainable.</p>

<p>I have some work to do the next two weeks but I think I will be able to release an early beta in October.</p>

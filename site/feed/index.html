                <title>I am the product - and that is okay</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>There are two types of online service you can use. On one you are the customer on the other you are the product. Lately, thanks to Instagram, there has been a lot of discussion if it is okay to provide a service to people just to sell their informations. Is this a valid business model? Is it the only business model which could work.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Before we continue, you should read this <a href="http://xkcd.com/1150/">XKCD comic</a> about Instagram. As I already said on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4952378">Hacker News</a> this comparison is IMHO not suitable. But let us start from the beginning.</p>

<p>I think we do not have to talk a lot about the different service models, we are all familiar with both of them. A direct competition for example is Twitter and App.net. On Twitter you are the product, on App.net you are a customer. As most of you know I am not the biggest fan of Twitter (I still use it, though). Some of their recent moves are IMHO a direct result of the fact that they still found no way to make a sustainable business with what they have. But why do I not just move to App.net?</p>

<p>Because sometimes it is okay to be the product. We are basically talking about your choice if you use service A, you are the customer, or B, you are the product.</p>

<h2>Are you willing to pay?</h2>

<p>The first question you have to ask yourself is if you are willing to pay for said service. You cannot get a service for free and believe developers and servers are paid by magical unicorns that shit money. I am not really sure what people expect when they get something for free. Did their parents not teach them not to take candy from the strange looking old man pointing to his minivan?</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes you get stuff for free with no strings attached, but this is mostly good will or a strategy to sell related services, features, whatever. If there is no obvious way how a company is making money you are likely seeing a "service B" type company.</p>

<p>If you are not willing to pay you have two options: be the product or do not use the service at all.</p>

<h2>What can happen if you are the product?</h2>

<p>This is a tricky question because it depends on you. I know this sucks, taking responsibility for your own actions and stuff. I cannot believe I even suggest this in the modern age. But let us imagine, for one second, that we were all brought up to be intelligent adults.</p>

<p>We are aware of the fact that we are dealing with a company of type B. We are the product. Here comes a really crazy thought. We just put informations up we do not care about if they are sold.</p>

<p>If Instagram can make a business model out of selling pictures of my fianceés cat, my morning coffee and some places I attend this is fine. I am not willing to pay for the service and they sell something I do not care about if it is sold.</p>

<p>What if Facebook sold my phone number to telephone marketers? I would hate that. I do not like being cold called. But wait - here is the tricky part: They do not have my number because I never uploaded it. Shocking, right? I do care about this piece of information, so I keep it as private as I think it is necessary.</p>

<p>This is a pretty old rule we all know. Only upload informations you are willing to share with the world. Each system has bugs, every company can change, everyone can once mess up privacy settings while adding someone to the "screw this guy" group.</p>

<h2>"But there are no alternatives!"</h2>

<p>This is my favorite argument. Show me one service your life depends on, which only exists because it is selling <em>all</em> your private informations. Sorry, but you are not forced to use anything the Internet has to offer. Joking aside, I know, in reality, we want to use those fancy services to stay in touch with people or get the latest news in real time.</p>

<p>If there is really no alternative of service type A you can still get an account on evil service B. Just do not upload anything. If you fear someone would sell your spam email account together with your name you really should not use anything which requires registration. As long as you upload nothing what can happen? They could try to track your surf behavior and show you related adds. Just use stealth mode and log out of the service.</p>

<p>If you start sharing informations or just engage in conversations - what exactly can happen? They could read them, sell them, most likely automatically search for keywords and show you ads. Even if they sell your complete conversation history: Just do not share nuclear weapon codes over Facebook. In the real world no one cares if you just invited five friends over to dinner.</p>

<h2>Uptopia</h2>

<p>Of course, I would love to see a world with free services for everyone. Services which can be used to do "the right" or "good" things. I think you know the examples - how reports or freedom fighters use those services to show cruel dictatorship and so on. Services where you own your data. Where you are free to post - as long as it is neither inhuman or illegal - whatever you want without fearing consequences from society, employers or governments.</p>

<p>But this is utopia. In the world we live in we can only get such a service if the company behind it can actually pay the bills and satisfy laws and regulations.</p>

<p>Let us imagine App.net would be this company. A company of type A. We all get an account, abandon Twitter and enjoy our life. What happens to those, who cannot pay $5 but have something important to say to the rest of the world? Should everyone else pay $50 to compensate them?</p>

<p>As a company which wants to open up for <em>everyone</em> you need a business model which either depends on some people paying for others or you start making money in a non traditional way. What do you think, which one is likelier to work out?</p>

<h2>I am a happy, little product!</h2>

<p>There are two easy rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only upload what you are willing to share with the whole world</li>
<li>If you do not pay for the service you are the product</li>
</ul>

<p>Free services have informations and data from me. And I'd like to repeat that I have no problem if they start selling it. It is not like the XKCD comic where I lose something. I still have my data. It is not gone. My images will not vanish from my phone and hard drive because Instagram sells them. The only result is a company making money, providing me a service I like and I am not willing to pay for, for free. Everyone wins.</p>

                <title>Week 1 - what happened?</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>I thought a bit about my blog and how blogging changed the last years. One thing I will try to bring back is a short overview what happened the whole week, what was interesting, what was new and what I did. I think this will also be a good way to rant about new projects.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Do you remember the times when you, mostly on Fridays, read link lists and other stuff people posted as weekly recap? It will not be something like this. Promise. There is also no need to bring this back. We have Twitter and other social networks. We can share this stuff in real time. Wasting the time of my readers with repeated URL spam is not something I want to do, especially since they are preserved in my <a href="http://notes.screamingatmyscreen.com">Tumbler account</a>.</p>

<h2>Editors</h2>

<p>I did not have much time writing code the last two weeks. Most of the time we had guests which means I could not get some hours of distraction free time. But I had some time to think about my development setup. Part of this will be a reason for another post. But what I noticed: Starting vim, after all those years, still feels like coming home. I do most of my work in Sublime Text 2 but a short <code>mvim ~/code/drupan</code> makes me want to add some plugins and start using it again. But sadly I always run into the same shortcomings. It is still ugly, I am looking at you NERDTree. Command-T and other plugins are still not as good as ST2s integrated solution. Those are just the two biggest problems I currently have.</p>

<p>I also find the lint-plugin quite useful but configuring this with vim and syntastic seems to involve the blood of a virgin, scarifying a goat and summoning some demons. </p>

<p>I do not need much from my editor. Syntax highlighting, sane indenting, Command-T and it should look nice. I refuse to use something that is ugly for hours and hours.</p>

<p>I tried ChocholatApp again. Somehow they managed to really fuck up. If I edit a CSS file and start writing a comment with <code>/*</code> all keystrokes are doubled and I cannot delete anything anymore. I am not sure if I run in some obscure keyboard shortcut because I am using a German layout or if there is just a bug. But looking good does not help if it is broken. And the integrated Command-T is just a joke.</p>

<p>Maybe I will give PeepOpen a chance and pay some $. If vim + PeepOpen work I would have nearly everything I could ask for.</p>

<h2>PEP8</h2>

<p>I am saying this, knowing that someone will flame me like I just killed a kitten: F<em>*</em> PEP8. I know why it was written, I always stuck to the rules. But I decided to break one of them. The most defended and discussed one. I will not limit my code-lines to 80 characters.</p>

<p>My biggest problem is that it is nearly impossible to write Django models without violating this rule. I could break lines but this just makes my code ugly. Ugly code is not the goal but it is inevitable if you write model files with an 80 character limit. Also if I write sentences that explain a command line argument e.x.. It is just a sentence and it will not make the code unreadable. But it will help making it look nicer and make scanning through the essential part faster.</p>

<h2>catntent</h2>

<p>What happens if you put three people in a room thinking about a name for a content management system? Right - cats in a tent. Could be a cute logo, right? And I thought playing World of Warcraft while finding a name was a stupid idea after I started blogging with a software which is called <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/drupan/">drunken panda</a>.</p>

<p>catntent is the CMS powering my companies homepage. I am currently working on it to release it under the BSD license.</p>

<p>I am using Django and separating most applications - this way you pick what you need, add it to a project, write your template or extend the apps. Most Django based systems I know brake with the app principle, force everything in one folder structure (mostly breaking down things like models, views, custom model managers…) you have to study and integrate everything so tightly that it is nearly impossible to replace parts of it.</p>

<h2>New Years Resolution</h2>

<p>There simply are none. I do not need a new year to change things. I do not wait till a certain point in time to try to improve. I just start doing it as fast as I can and see a reason to. Just as a short clarification since some people asked.</p>

<h2>Next Week</h2>

<p>I currently have three posts waiting to be published. I fear @sternenkind getting sick of reading my ramblings and trying to make some sentences suck less. I should also update my portfolio and if I find some time rework the about section of this site. I wish you a great week :)</p>

                <title>The Cloud vs. Dedicated Servers</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>I used a lot of my time the last two weeks to work on the hosting option for <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/drupan">drupan</a> powered sites. While splitting up tasks in services I thought about all the possibilities how I could host them. I looked at AWS, Heroku, Rackspace and considered renting some dedicated servers from Hetzner. To be honest I am surprised by the outcome. I hope to give you a decent overview and maybe a bit help to decide what works for you if you are in a similar situation.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Just as a quick introduction for those who do not know me: I like servers. Setup, scaling and administration is nothing I consider to be a necessary evil, but actually enjoy it from time to time. When I started organizing network parties with my old team I spent more time with game servers, the network and working on the tournament system than gaming. I think I know pretty well (after all those years) how to install a database, add ssh keys to a system and make sure the web server is up to date. So it would not be a problem to go the dedicated way. Of course there would be the point where I would need help from people who are specialized in database design / sharding / partitioning, etc - likely earlier than going the cloud hosting route.
I realize my strengths and weaknesses and I believe that I do not have to and cannot specialize in everything, so hiring if needed is a viable option for me.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Before you start looking at the different options you should know what you need. I need block storage. This means hosting only on Heroku would not be possible. I want to use a CDN for the static generated sites. This has two advantages.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the backend goes down or a hosting provider has problems customer domains are still online.</li>
<li>Performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The load on systems is currently unpredictable. If 20 users generate their site at the same moment is a completely other beast than 2 users updating a site in the morning and evening.
There will also be an option to rent dedicated backends and frontends with a custom branding. Easy and fast provisioning is definitely a plus.</p>

<h2>Stability and Performance</h2>

<p>If you search for experiences with cloud providers you find as many opinions as people writing. The cloud is great, the cloud is bad. Moving to Heroku, moving away from Heroku. 100% uptime to "crashes if I run <code>uptime</code>". From some points on earth one CDN is faster than another and so on.</p>

<p>There are some things you should always remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>the cloud does not mean you pay nothing and get all the performance a datacenter can offer</li>
<li>you will have downtimes</li>
<li>it is easier to minimize downtime </li>
<li>it is faster to get processing power, storage or memory if you need it</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall it is easier to react to problems, needs and give various options a try and see how it performs in testing or production if you choose a cloud provider. At least if you do not want to buy systems "just in case, if you are lucky, and if the stars align right,…" you could need.</p>

<h2>Amazon Web Services</h2>

<p>If I would have to describe AWS in one sentence it would be: "You get everything you dream of and pay for everything they can measure." It is really that easy. Need a task queue? SQS. Payment processing? FPS. Block storage? EBS. And the list goes on and on. As I said you pay for everything. IOPS, Traffic, requests - you can measure it? You pay for it. I actually prefer this to a certain point. If I pay for the resources I use they make money. If they make money they are less likely to go out of business.</p>

<p>While visiting an AWS event in Leipzig I had the chance to talk to some people. Now that I considered using AWS I send a mail with my open questions. Two days later everything was answered. I described what I wanted to do. The - I think - sales engineer answering my questions also commented on the possibilities and shortcomings and how to compensate them. The pre sales service was great.</p>

<p>Another thing I like is the fact that you get a free tier which you can actually use to test your idea. Of course micro instances are not the most powerful option the world has ever seen, 100000 SQS requests are just enough for two request every minute. Depending on your use case this can be enough. Or you have to pay $2.70 / month for a service which queries the queue every second. But over all you get a decent free package.</p>

<p>Before you can see or use anything you have to enter your credit card informations. They will not take your instance down, they charge you if you go over the free limit. You also cannot get any statistics how your next bill will look like. For me, this is not really pleasant.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You can get everything you need from one provider</li>
<li>Usable administration interface</li>
<li>Lots of different systems (High CPU, high memory,…)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You have to learn Amazons vocabulary. Always three letters, with the first one either standing for "simple" or "elastic".</li>
<li>Calculating your monthly costs is nearly impossible if you do not have usage statistics before moving to AWS.</li>
<li>Not really cheap</li>
<li>Contact sales before buying - there are some limitations I could not directly find on the page / FaQ (maximum 100 buckets on S3 e.x.)</li>
<li>Look out for vendor lockin</li>
<li>IMHO bad documentation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Heroku</h2>

<p>Using Heroku somehow gave me a comfy feeling. They are just doing everything right. You can either use the web interface or a command line tool. You just push your repository and the magic happens. Not sure how something works? Clean and structured help and FaQs. You just do not see all the stuff you would have to do if you use your own server.</p>

<p>I cannot say how their pre sales support looks like because I did not need to contact them. A really good sign.</p>

<p>The pricing is reasonable and you get nearly everything for free to test stuff. Want a task queue? Choose from different providers who are happy to sell you a hosted RabbitMQ or a hosted Redis instance. Free options are not always sufficient for anything else than testing but this is fine for me. I can see if my applications still work when deployed, what else can you want?</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Open Source based services with a free tier</li>
<li>Reasonable pricing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No storage options. (If you do not need them great, else go for S3 e.x.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rackspace</h2>

<p>Rackspace offers servers, storage, a CDN, and other stuff just with a lot better pricing model than AWS. They have no equivalent for services like FPS e.x. but this is a really special case if you ask me. You do not have to pay for everything they can measure. The pricing structure is really clear and easy to follow.</p>

<p>They advertise their great support. My first experience was the live chat which did not work on OSX (Safari, no add ons) or my iPad and always faded over something, on every page, I wanted to read. But if you manage to reach someone they give you fast and clear answers.</p>

<p>Pricing is comparable to AWS. Sadly they offer no free tier. You have to pay to test if you would be comfortable working with them or if people will actually like what you do. But beside that it is a really good option. Looking at their CDN and the pricing it just beats S3 / Cloud Front. No requests or other stuff to consider. You pay for bandwidth and storage. Simple and easy pricing.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sane pricing model</li>
<li>Lots of different systems (High CPU, high memory,…)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No free tier</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dedicated Servers</h2>

<p>There is always the option to rent servers. You have to administrate them, compensate downtimes, plan for crashes and recovery and all the other stuff we know. If you already have a team doing this kind of work and have the money to buy more servers than you actually need (backup systems, spare systems if you have to scale…) this is a really viable option.</p>

<p>If you only want to write code and have no experience with system administration dedicated servers are no option for you. If you think you can just buy a box, put everything on it and see what happens you should not even think about this option.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Could be cheaper</li>
<li>Full control of your environment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Will likely be more expensive</li>
<li>More work</li>
<li>Slower provisioning</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overall Ranking</h2>

<p>While dedicated hosting is a two edged sword it could be a viable path if all the time and work you have to put into it are okay for you.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you do not need block storage or other stuff go for Heroku. They are doing a great job making your life as developer simple. </li>
<li>You need block storage or other features you do not get using Heroku? Rackspace. Better pricing model, it is that simple for me.</li>
<li>If you need a lot of different services beyond the stuff Heroku and Rackspace offers go for AWS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those three cloud providers offer different levels of services from "hosting your application" to "just tell us what you need, we have a three-letter-service offering exactly this, just be prepared to pay for everything you can imagine".</p>

<p>The difference between AWS and Rackspace are not that big. The most important point is the clear pricing model and the better documentation if you choose Rackspace.</p>

<h3>Combining Providers</h3>

<p>There is always the option to combine and mix different providers. Use Rackspace Files with your frontend on Heroku and your workers and storage on AWS for example. Depending on your preferences you could get the best out of all clouds. On the other hand it is, at least in my opinion, a disadvantage if you have to look in three different administration consoles, have three different bills and contact three different support teams if something goes wrong and you do not know what exactly happens.</p>

<p>To prevent a vendor lockin on AWS you can also use hosted services you would use if you go for Heroku. Most of them offer a free tier on their homepage. Or you just get a lot EC2 instances and start setting up your own services, although I do not recommend this. You have to do the whole sysops work and likely have to pay more than you would have to pay if you just go for the AWS service.</p>

<h3>Drupan-hosted</h3>

<p>I will likely use AWS and Rackspace. Payment is troublesome in Europe, Stripe is still not here, the free tier allows me to evaluate the service without taking a too big risk. The only thing I will use Rackspace for is their CDN offering. Just a lot more appealing than S3 and Cloud Front. Especially if you consider that you do not get statistics based on buckets and domains. Because of this shortcoming I would not be able to offer usage based pricing to my customers. I would have to assume x connections for every y GB transferred. Not really fair if you ask me.</p>

                <title>Selling Your Service Or Product - The Basics</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>Last week I was talking to 14 boys and girls about IT. Their school offered an orientation day and I was invited as a speaker. One of them was especially interested in selling products. Now this is something I wanted to talk about for a long time on my blog. Maybe you remember the <a href="/2012/5/time-to-talk-about-business/">"talk about business"</a> series?
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>I used to make a big part of my living as consultant for eight years. I had the opportunity to learn from great, international coaches and at the same time practice what I learned. The basic idea of selling and consulting is always the same - no matter if we talk about software or a vacuum cleaner. And still so many people (even big companies) do it horrible wrong. Of course really big companies get away with it most of the time, but this is due to other factors. For us it is interesting to know how we should market and sell our product or the service we just built.</p>

<h2>Marketing And Selling Is Important</h2>

<p>I know enough people who think sales persons or marketing departments are utterly useless. They believe a great product is enough. Most of the time those people are the ones who build fantastic applications, hardware or services. Sadly those are the same people who do not understand that not everyone is like them. If they see something new and think it could be interesting they give it a try. Other people just don't.</p>

<p>Customers do not want stunning websites with a lot of descriptions what a great product can do. They do not even care about the built-in cheese grater. They want someone who listens to their problems and tells them how they can fix it with this special product. Some tech-savvy, misanthropic assholes will be offended and disagree, but "humans need humans" was, is and will be a universal truth.</p>

<p>No matter how good your product is, if no one knows about it, if your competitors send someone with a demonstration device to potential customers or if people do not fully understand your product no one will buy it. Not even if it is the best one available.</p>

<h2>Know Your Product</h2>

<p>If you do not know the product you cannot sell it. It is really that easy. If your potential customers asks questions and you have no idea or have to call someone or read your own flyer - then you have a problem. There is nothing that makes selling harder to impossible than being caught off guard on basic questions.</p>

<p>This does not mean you have to know every little detail. You should know if your web service is able to send newsletters to customers. You do not have to know how to partition databases to scale it.</p>

<p>There is a difference between knowing a product and knowing every detail. On the one hand, you should know as much as possible - but on the other hand it's no shame to call your office and ask a developer if and how this special scenario could be realized. </p>

<p>If a client has some special needs and you talk to one of your developers before promising that it will work you have another advantage: Your client can be sure that you are not just some sales person promising pink ponies to land a deal. At least this is what clients believe. Developers know the software they build and what it is capable of, right?</p>

<h2>Know Your Contenders</h2>

<p>If you are selling a software as a service, for example, then you have to know your competitors. What if a potential client already is a customer of someone else? What if they ask you about the differences to evaluate which solutions fits their needs? You have to be able to answer those questions. But there is one thing you should not do:</p>

<p>Never start telling your potential customers why other products suck. Never ever.</p>

<p>I cannot stress this enough. If you are not explicitly asked about the differences, you talk about the strengths and advantages of your product. And if you are asked you talk about the strengths and advantages of your product.</p>

<p>I know some people will call me fanboy for this one but the example just works. Imagine an elderly women who wants to buy a smartphone. You tell her that the new Samsung Galaxy 7 has a 90" screen, 500 cores and 45 petabyte memory. 
I just give her an iPhone, tell her to type the number of her daughter, hit FaceTime and she can see her grandchild.</p>

<p>You can tell her that the iPhone has far inferior hardware. 
I can tell her how easy it is to use and that she can always call her daughter and see her grandchildren rise. I do not have to explain to her why the specs don't matter, manufacturing quality or anything else.</p>

<p>Some of you might now argue that this example is wrong because the Galaxy and "what if"… you get the point. This example sucks, but it's the best one I can come up with at the moment. Let us continue.</p>

<h3>If You Have A Bad Product</h3>

<p>You should be aware of the weaknesses of your product.
There is, most of the time, not only one product for a certain task and most of the time you have different trade offs if you choose one of the products over another.</p>

<p>But what do you do when your product is just bad? Cheap components, known problems, not matching any use case?</p>

<p>Stop selling it. If you sell crap people will notice at a certain point. Get another job.</p>

<p>There was a new client I visited for the first time. Coffee was prepared and it was just a matter of "What do you need?", "What makes sense for you?", questions and statements. 
How did I get this client? Another client recommended me. </p>

<p>The new client knew that I do not make promises I cannot fulfill and that I also admit if there are weaknesses in one of the products or scenarios where it is problematic. And still, I did not need to convince him that those products are still worth buying. I showed him how he can solve the problem he has with the product I have. Nothing more. </p>

<p>This appointment only went so smooth because a previous client recommended me. Not my product. Customers and clients sometimes care more about the people who sell something than about the actual product. This also means that you do not sell them something they do not need - or your reputation will suffer.</p>

<h2>Service Always Starts After You Sold</h2>

<p>Take care of problems. Call or email your new customer personally. Do not let your secretary handle everything. Know their birthday. Maybe, if it came up in a conversation, the birthdays of wife, husband or kids. Remember the dates and gratulate them personally.</p>

<p>This is one of the differences between selling something and building a client relationship. Be nice, keep your promises and from time to time just let him know you remember him without directly calling to sell something.</p>

<p>Maybe you have candy or other merchandise stuff with your company brand. Throw it away. Kids do not want company branded chocolate. They want an ordinary chocolate bar they know and like. Most of the time this branded stuff tastes awful, and no one needs yet another ruler.</p>

<p>Know what your client likes. Wine, Whisky or chocolate - get something that tastes good without your brand. These are birthday or Christmas gifts people remember. Especially if you have a present for their kids or even a snack for their pets. </p>

<h2>In A Nutshell</h2>

<p>These are only rough, not completely elaborated points about best practices. They can be a bit different depending on your country, on your product, your personality and your client.</p>

<p>But there are some things I consider to be a universal truth:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be honest</li>
<li>You have to sell to make money</li>
<li>Talk about strengths of your product</li>
<li>Treat other people with respect</li>
<li>Keep promises</li>
<li>Only sell if it makes sense for the customer</li>
<li>Don't sell garbage</li>
<li>Service starts after the deal is closed</li>
<li>A good reputation is essential</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot more to say about selling and marketing and I will likely take the time and talk about every point in its own post.</p>

<p>But if you now think: "Doh, of course! This is simple. No need to talk about this stuff!", ask yourself if every sales and support person you encountered in your life followed this easy and simple principles we should not even have to mention.</p>

<p>But now that the basics are clear we can talk about some more serious and in depth about those points.</p>

                <title>Django Beginner Series - Introduction</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>Some Twitter followers could already know that I am working on a book. Just not what it is about. Big announcement: It will be about web application development using Django. It is supposed to be an easy entry in the world of Django and tries to cover as much as possible in a simple way to get started with the framework.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>If you do not care why I am doing this skip to "ideas and how this blog is involved" to get an idea what tutorials I will post in the course of the next weeks.</p>

<p>Django is the best documented project I know. You can find nearly anything in the documentation and if you are not comfortable browsing it you can just read the code with comments. But there is something Django lacks. I know that not everyone agrees with me on this. But I also know how many people asked me basic things they could not figure out just from reading the tutorial. Django needs some basic introduction material.</p>

<p>I do not think it would be wise to rewrite the whole documentation. If I want to know something about a model field, how a battery works or just see if there is something I am missing about a problem the documentation is great. But it does not walk you through the process of creating a basic application that actually works. At least not good enough as it looks to me.</p>

<p>I am aware that there are great resources and that there is even a "community driven book". But this brings me to another point. There are nearly no books written in German about Django. I think I have seen one. Sometimes it only has a little paragraph, maybe a chapter in a book about Python but nothing serious. Other books, written in English, are just so outdated it hurts.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with Django and my company realizes projects based on it on a regular basis. I would love to see more people using Django and I think this could be a way to give something back to the project. A little thank you, spreading the word and showing the great possibilities and reasons why more people should consider using Django.</p>

<h2>Ideas And How This Blog Is Involved</h2>

<p>I know that I am not in the position to provide a solid English translation of the book directly after it is finished. Not without some help. And I am also not sure when I will find the time to translate it. So I had another idea.</p>

<p>In the book I will use examples that are supposed to help my readers with real world problems. We will build</p>

<ul>
<li>a basic content management system</li>
<li>some kind of wiki</li>
<li>a tumblelog</li>
<li>something that will remind you of Twitter</li>
</ul>

<p>Beside the basic idea how to start such projects I can introduce management commands, migrations, templating, user accounts and profiles, project layout and structure and other stuff without boring everyone to death.</p>

<p>To reach more people I will link the examples in this blog and add tutorials how everything is put together.</p>

<p>The four "big projects" are currently only ideas. I am still looking for some input what I should include and what I should leave out of the tutorials. The goal is pretty simple: "Introduce enough features so everyone has a basic understanding how Django works and hopefully will be able to realize any project with the help of the documentation". I refuse to copy big parts of the docs, this would make the whole project pointless.</p>

<p>If you have any ideas, wishes or comments send me a <a href="mailto:timo@screamingatmyscreen.com">mail</a>, comment on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4749368">Hacker News</a> or send me a <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fallenhitokiri">tweet</a>.</p>

                <title>The iPad Mini Is Not For You</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>Yesterday Apple introduced the iPad mini. As always I had two different types of people in my Twitter timeline. Those who tried to order it before the keynote was finished and those who explained why the iPad mini is a big disappointment. I believe it is great, just not for "us".
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>With "us" I mean me and likely everyone who is reading this blog. There are some exceptions, of course. Those who want a small eBook reader without sacrifycing the features of an iPad will be happy with the iPad mini. Everyone else will stick to the iPad as we know it.</p>

<h2>iPad mini As eBook Reader</h2>

<p>I recently started using my iPad to read a book. First I was not sure if I like a display in front of me or if it will be comfortable enough. I've been reading books for some years now and I am just used to those paper things. It works. Always. They are never low on battery, never required a charger, are instantly on, I do not have to update them and can always read them, not only in areas where books are "allowed". But I thought I should give eBooks a fair chance.</p>

<p>Three days later I am convinced that I will stick to it. It is easier to handle, I do not have to find a light source (I read in my bed most of the time) and, even if it is a lot of fun, I do not have to visit a book store if I do not want to. I also trust Apple to not pull an <a href="http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/">Amazon</a> on me.</p>

<p>But since I am not one of the biggest book lovers on earth I talked to my spouse. She basically owns more books than every library I know and still believes it is not enough. Books are her shoes. She explained to me that the iPad is nice but a bit too big for her liking to effectively replace a book. So the iPad mini would be ideal for her to replace books - only talking about size and weight, not the fact that some part of her is a little book snob and likely will never joining the digital gang.</p>

<h3>No Retina Display</h3>

<p>I do not see the lack of a retina display as bad. I still use my iPad first generation to read books. Of course a retina display is nice. But as long as you do not directly compare both displays to each other, the first generation iPad is still fairly good for reading.</p>

<p>Now the iPad mini has the same resolution on a smaller display. PPI are nearer to the retina display, even if still not there. We have to wait till someone actually uses the device to know if it is "near enough".</p>

<h2>Features, Specs and Quality</h2>

<p>I had a short <a href="https://twitter.com/fallenhitokiri/status/260836338230775808">tweet-exchange</a> with Jeff Croft. He is not really a big fan of the specs. There is no point in arguing, he is right.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-in-reply-to="260831959926841344"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/fallenhitokiri">fallenhitokiri</a> Totally agree. More than happy to pay a premium for high-end build quality. A 65% premium AND a shitty screen, tho? Too much</p>&mdash; Jeff Croft (@jcroft) <a href="https://twitter.com/jcroft/status/260832245034647552" data-datetime="2012-10-23T19:57:07+00:00">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This little piece of tech is not bleeding edge. It does not have a retina display. It is not the fastest tablet the world has ever seen. It is small. It is a full featured iOS device. It is cheap compared to its "big brothers". It is a device you buy if you want iOS and not pay half a monthly income.</p>

<p>But the big difference to other tablets or eBook readers is iOS. I cannot stress this enough. Full featured iOS device for ~$300. If you really only want to read eBooks you have to decide if you want <a href="http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/">Amazon DRM</a> or Apple. Hard decision when you can go for Apple and get both services and some more iOS magic.</p>

<p>What is not questionable is the iPad mini vs all other Android devices around $200-$300. I want quality. Not plastic. It is that easy. Most cheap tablets I hold in my hands so far were… cheap. You notice it when you hold them, when you touch them and when you type on them.</p>

<h2>Target Group</h2>

<p>Even if the specs are not premium the overall quality still is. And this is another big selling point. You get Apple quality and software for a low entry price.</p>

<p>Most people I have seen being disappointed by the iPad mini are tech-savvy. They know what a CPU is, they know what a retina display is and they do more than just reading a mail and a book or sometimes visiting a homepage to see if their favorite sports team won.</p>

<p>You can consider the iPad mini an gateway drug. You want iOS and Apple quality but you are still not sold on it. Now you do not discuss if you can spare &gt; $500. You think about $300. It makes a big difference.</p>

<p>If you take away all the tech stuff we all love (and just look at use cases and money you have to spend to get a device which is capable of fulfilling your needs) the iPad mini magically appears to make sense.</p>

<h2>I Am Not Disappointed</h2>

<p>But I still will not buy it. I do not have to optimize applications for another display resolution, I am comfortable with a bigger screen and I want retina. It is easy. The big one.</p>

<p>My parents on the other hand just read some mails, sometimes visit a sports site, look at a power point presentation or FaceTime with me. Do they need all those fancy features, specs and power? No.</p>

<p>Maybe Kenneth Reitz is right, at least it could be possible and I see a chance that this will happen.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>If the iPad Mini launches today at $300 or less, I fully expect it to replace desktop computers for 90% of my family members.</p>&mdash; Kenneth Reitz (@kennethreitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/kennethreitz/status/260734427531984896" data-datetime="2012-10-23T13:28:26+00:00">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Let us be honest. Most people do not need a computer. They need an email client and a browser on a device they cannot break or mess up. Overall quality and usability are more important than specs.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The iPad mini is great for people who do not care about specs, want a tool for a limited range of certain tasks and are not willing to pay a lot of money to get a device for trivial things which has features they do not care about.
Everyone else will stick to its bigger brothers.</p>

                <title>Zenbo, Zenbo As A Service And Pricing</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>After a week of working on Zenbo (and desperately searching for a new name, as this one is already protected by someone else) there are some news I want to share with you. Sadly not everything worked as expected and there were some private issues I had to take care of. But the good news are that I am on a good track for a release. Let me give you an overview what happened and what you can expect.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>First of all there were some major commits and pushes to the <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/Zenbo">GitHub repository</a>. Some changes that look small but make a lot of sense if you take the greater picture into consideration.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Each plugin will now ship with a default configuration. This means that you can, if you are happy with the defaults, run with a configuration file that only consists of three lines. A major step for people starting to use Zenbo.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are some things left to do. There will be a way to run Zenbo with defaults and command line arguments. This is needed for the hosting.</p>

<h3>Plugins</h3>

<p>There are no categories for plugins anymore. There is just a plugin with a <code>run</code> method in a class called <code>Feature</code>. The order in which plugins are executed is determinate by the order in which they are listed in the configuration file.</p>

<p>This makes it easy to add a base class for common features which will happen at one point. This way configuration handling will be provided by Zenbo and not be the job of every plugin and plugin author.</p>

<h3>Usability</h3>

<p>Today I started working on a way to setup a new site with <code>zenbo --init</code>. It is still a bit rough around the edges but I think it will be done tomorrow. The goal is making it easy for people without prior Zenbo experience getting a site up and running with one command. Deployment excluded.</p>

<h2>Zenbo As A Service</h2>

<p>I talked about <a href="http://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/2012/9/23/updates_on_zenbo_and_zenbo-hosted.html">zenbo-hosted</a>. Some people asked why we need another hosting and blogging service. The answer is pretty easy. I want it for my own and my companies projects.</p>

<p>Most of the time there is no reason for full featured content management systems and there is also no reason to waste money of clients for server resources and hosting they do not really need. With Zenbo as a service there is a way to edit sites in the browser and still benefit from the advantages of a static generated site.</p>

<p>Everyone who prefers a fast and easy to use hosting service, who wants to edit files locally and test a site before it goes live, designers who love the freedom doing what they want, not being tied to the annoyances and limitations of a CMS, everyone who loves git and vim will hopefully enjoy it.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>

<p>There will be a longer post how everything will work but a quick overview.</p>

<p>The backend will be hosted on a dedicated server. Adding content, no matter if you push with git or add it through the web interface will cause a commit in the git repository which will trigger a hook that starts generating your site.</p>

<p>Between the generation and the repository will be Celery which will make sure the same site is not generated multiple times parallel, that there are not 500 processes fighting over system resources and finally notify the front end if everything is fine or if problems occurred. My last tests indicate that generating 100 sites parallel should be fine on a small box. And thanks to some revised design decisions it will be easy to just add more or bigger boxes.</p>

<p>The final site will be hosted on S3. This will add a hughe performance boost over one or two server and cut down costs. If a customer still wants more performance I will offer a CloudFront add-on. This is, at least for my current knowledge, the fastest possible site you can have. No backend wasting time on generating content, servers near every customer visiting your site, in one word: performance.</p>

<h3>Pricing</h3>

<p>Now that I had some time evaluating my options I decided what the pricing will look like. Thanks to an Amazon Web Services event in Leipzig I had the opportunity to talk to some people and answer some open questions.</p>

<p>Zenbo-hosted will be free for everything which is non-commercial. There will be some strings attached to it. Those are still a topic that has to be discussed.</p>

<ul>
<li>private sites will always be free</li>
<li>no advertisement, or anything else</li>
<li>no file hosting</li>
<li>non-profit organizations have special rules</li>
</ul>

<h3>File Hosting</h3>

<p>This is just a matter of costs. I want to keep the service free with no strings attached for private usage. Putting up a 2MB PDF with your résumé is fine. Images and image galleries are fine. Uploading the last season of Buffy you just ripped for your friends is not cool. Not only because of the costs but also because of all the DMCA stuff I would have to answer.</p>

<h3>Non-profit Organizations</h3>

<p>Most of the time they cause some decent traffic and have some money at their hands for organizational costs. The only thing that changes is that they are halt to put "powered by Zenbo-hosted" in the footer of the site.</p>

<p>If a non-profit organization decides to use Zenbo I hope they will get in touch with me. I would be happy to support them and provide add-on packages as a donation.</p>

<h3>Companies</h3>

<p>Basically pretty easy. $5 / month as basic plan and you pay what you use. That is it. Without any add-ons this is everything you have to pay for.</p>

<h3>Add-Ons</h3>

<p>There will be several add-on packages you can order which will be a paid service. I am not sure if they will be all available at the beginning but they should appear in the course of this year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Post by mail</li>
<li>Hosting files</li>
<li>Dedicated backend</li>
<li>Mail service</li>
<li>API to submit any form you put on your site</li>
<li>Custom plugins</li>
<li>Domain service / DNS</li>
<li>AWS CloudFront support</li>
</ul>

<p>Beside the file hosting all features will be around $1 to $3 a month. I think this is reasonable and affordable.</p>

<h2>Why Am I Building This?</h2>

<p>Because I believe people will enjoy using it. Because I want to offer a different approach to classic hosting services. Because it is fun. Because it will be beneficial for my company. Because I hope some people who did amazing stuff that helped me do my job and run my business will notice it and use it - my way of saying "thank you".</p>

<p>There are many reasons. For me, the most important ones are fun, saying "thank you" and providing a solid base for future projects I and my company will be working on.</p>

                <title>Updates On Zenbo And Zenbo-hosted</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>After a week of doing nearly nothing, thanks to a really bad cold, I managed to get some testing and coding done. I thought I give you some updates how your favorite project is doing and how soon you will see the release of the last blogging platform you will ever need.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>This is one of the names and slogans that were suggested for Zenbo-hosted. While I liked this one, even if it maybe not 100% accurate, here are some more.</p>

<ul>
<li>yet another blogging platform</li>
<li>static blogging</li>
<li>scaled blogging</li>
<li>blogging with fun again</li>
</ul>

<p>I also thought about just using Zenbo. Name the service after the core software that is used. I had far worser ideas, believe me. The final decisions will be made in some weeks, so I am not really stressed making my mind up.</p>

<h3>Zenbo</h3>

<p>Today Zenbo learned what tags are and how they work. The documentation is not really finished but I did not find any bugs in the implementation so I just pushed it to the <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/Zenbo">repository on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>One of the main things I have to fix before the first release will be the way Zenbo reads and uses the configuration. A plugin should ship with sane defaults. Currently you have to add all configuration options to <code>config.yaml</code> which is not really comfortable, fast or clean.</p>

<p>Also it will be a lot easier to integrate Zenbo in zenbo-hosted if the configuration is internally represented as an object.</p>

<p>I think we will see the last beta version next week. After adding some more tests and finished the crawler everything should be ready for 1.0.0, except the documentation which is a different topic.</p>

<h3>Zenbo-hosted</h3>

<p>I have a basic implementation of the backend. Currently only working if the backend and web server are running on the same server. Separating the backend from the fronted needs some time. I am not sure if I will just use <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.4.3/index.html">Fabric</a> or integrate SSH to run commands on a remote system. Fabric seems to be the better way.</p>

<p>Adding multiple fronted servers on the other hand is already integrated. To be honest I am just to lazy to change the database scheme, even if it is quiet easy thanks to <a href="http://south.aeracode.org">South</a>.</p>

<p>I am also not happy with the way I create git repositories. I subprocess too much for my taste but finding a python git library that does not suck is not as easy as it sounds.</p>

<p>Pricing is also nearly set. Free for non-commercial use. I am not sure how to price companies but I thought about something like 10k requests / $x. Not sure what x needs to be to make this service sustainable.</p>

<p>I have some work to do the next two weeks but I think I will be able to release an early beta in October.</p>

                <title>Taking Zenbo To The Next Level - Zenbo-hosted</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>The beta is running pretty great and I am making progress towards a <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/8/14/the_road_to_zenbo_1_0.html">1.0 release candidate</a>. While working on <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/9/9/my_stack_is_bigger_than_yours_-_ranting_about_web_applications_and_scalability.html">a project</a> for my company to enable forms and other dynamic features in Zenbo I thought about something totally different. Providing a hosted service for Zenbo. How exactly would this look like?
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Before I start I want to mention that I do not plan becoming the next Tumblr or Posterous and that I also have no intention to compete with Wordpress over the last 14 year old who just wants to post about his new puppy. Neither are the plans really polished or in a final "I have a big announcement" state. This is more a public brainstorming to see if I get some reactions or people who would be interested and give it a try.</p>

<p>Zenbo-hosted, internal development name which is still open for discussion, would target a certain group of people. A group I did not believe would be interested in such a service till I read a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt">Gary Bernhardt</a> (which I cannot find anymore. He tweets too much) and did some research to find out that more people would love to see such a service.</p>

<p>I thought that developers and tech-savvy people are fine running their own blog and server. After looking at some posts there is one common sentence: "I would love a service that lets me do $this and $that." Turns out some people just want a great platform and do not care about something trivial like blogging software and running <code>apt-get update; apt-get upgrade</code> from time to time.</p>

<p>Now what would Zenbo-hosted look like?</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Admin interface to quickly post from a browser</li>
<li>Service to post by mail</li>
<li>Still everything in a git repository</li>
<li>Static generated site</li>
<li>Backend service so you can submit forms, save them and receive them as mail</li>
<li>Everything in git</li>
</ul>

<p>So you would basically be free how to submit content. Write it in vim and push your repository, write in your browser like you would do it with every other content management system or send posts via mail. The backend service is in my opinion not as necessary for most people who would be interested in a git based hosted blog platform but a nice to have. Okay, I also have a nearly finished implementation, so why not? :)</p>

<h3>Scaling</h3>

<p>I do not believe I will attract high traffic sites that make it to the frontpage of HN once a week. But since developers have a tendency to write great posts it could be possible that there are unknown amounts of visits. I currently think and hope that this would not become a problem.</p>

<p>Hopelesscom currently runs on the <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/hosting/produkte_vserver/vq7">smallest vServer Hetzner</a> offers with some stuff consuming huge amounts of the already small amount of RAM. Just a default, unoptimized lighttpd without any caching. My <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/9/9/my_stack_is_bigger_than_yours_-_ranting_about_web_applications_and_scalability.html">last post</a> had 40-70k requests/hour. The server did not show any significant load. It did not even go above 1.00.  </p>

<p>Scaling is the thing that would likely give me the most headaches. If people really trust me to host their blogs they use to publish great stuff I want those blogs to be available all the time. No matter how. Thanks to the nature of static sites the last possible solution, namely Amazon S3, should be the one that should always work if everything else would fail me.</p>

<h3>Pricing Model And LockIn</h3>

<p>Initial thought was to just make it free.</p>

<p>If developers and people who currently pay a small VPS for a moderate known site just donate 50% of their current hosting costs it should be more than enough. I refuse to even talk and think about a sell-out or an ad based model.</p>

<p>I see Zenbo-hosted as a fun side project and I do not care if I make $5 or invest $5 as long as I do not pay thousands of dollars every month for other peoples blog. I want this service, I build this service. (The implementation I currently build for my company is definitely nothing I or other tech-savvy people would love to use. It targets a complete different group of people.)</p>

<p>Now you could ask: "Why should we trust him to provide a service I like?" or "what if he screws up and notices that his blue eyed, trusting in mankind, pricing model does not work?" I have a pretty easy answer. Zenbo-hosted, as Zenbo, will be open source. If you like the way it works - roll your own. If you start hating Zenbo, you already have a full copy of your content on your hard disk. I cannot think of a way how it would be easier to migrate everything away.</p>

<h3>Me Likes, Me Wants</h3>

<p>If you are interested in Zenbo-hosted just drop me a line, a tweet, send a bird with a message or set something on fire, dance around it and make some smoke signals.</p>

<p>I will build the tools around Zenbo-hosted in some weekend- or evening sessions and release them. I am just not sure if enough people would like seeing me buy some servers and providing everything as a service.</p>

                <title>My Stack Is Bigger Than Yours - Ranting About Web Applications And Scalability</title>
                <link></link>
                <description><p>Building a web application is serious business. Reading start up blogs, High Scalability or other sites you see many different tools, opinions how stuff should be designed and build, how you should deploy everything and of course even more opinions why this particular stack is superior to everything else. Sadly people who read this believe they have to do the same things and use as many tools as everyone else does.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>Let me give you an example. I build <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/8/14/the_road_to_zenbo_1_0.html">Zenbo</a> and I am currently using it for two clients. They both want a contact form and one of them also wants a form for his job page so people can submit an application. I was aware that this would eventually happen when I was writing Zenbo and I also had a plan for this situation: Writing a backend service. Use Ajax to send the form to it and store it. Send users a mail that there is a new message and add a web interface so they can check it and mark it as 'read'.</p>

<p>This is the trivial version which covers the immediate needs. There are some plans for extending it, but they will need some time and will likely be finished at the end of the year.</p>

<p>The basic plan is using Zenbo for as much projects as possible and provide a solid hosting service. Scaling is easy, sites can look the way my clients and I want them to look and with some backend power there is not drawback. So it could be possible that I will have to add more features and face some serious traffic.</p>

<h3>How To Solve This The Start Up Way</h3>

<p>If I build dynamic sites I use Django. But my backend is more of a service and an API. Naturally Flask came to my mind. If you do not know why I suggest you take a look at Kenneth Reitz - "Why Django sucks". But I could also think of Ruby On Rails which is, in my humble opinion, a good framework for fast and basic REST and CRUD.</p>

<p>I thought about joining all fields, storing them in one key and let the frontend handle the presentation. There is no need for indexing and searching, so it does not hurt. A key (client specific) with a value (form data) are the easiest way to use the same backend for all clients. If I think of key value storage I think of Redis. Adding store to PostgreSQL could also work.</p>

<p>Sending EMails? Just add a job to Celery. A queue systems and some worker scripts should be fine.</p>

<p>Webinterface? Well, it could be great to build a single page application so it feels responsive and improves the user experience. Node.js is the new black for SPAs. </p>

<p>Deployment? As much as I love Fabric, Chef seems to do a better job. Not sure about that, but most start ups seem to choose Chef over Fabric and they are all pretty smart - so they should know what they are doing, right?</p>

<p>So what do we have so far? </p>

<p>Programming/Scripting languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>Frameworks, applications and tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>Zenbo</li>
<li>Flask</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Celery</li>
<li>Chef</li>
<li>Redis</li>
</ul>

<p>We use the best tools and best frameworks for every part of the system. This is great, right?</p>

<h3>How To Solve It In A Sane Way</h3>

<p>Write a freaking Django application. Use the tools you know are often suggested and most of the time sufficient. It is easy to learn most of the tools I mentioned, especially since I know most of the stuff already and would only need to look up some stuff I do not have present in my mind.</p>

<p>Add the application to <code>/backend</code> and post your data. Store it in a PostgreSQL database with three fields. Id, key, value. Create a web interface. If a user logs in query the database, read all entries where <code>key</code> matches the user key and show the values in a nice way.</p>

<h3>The Big Difference</h3>

<p>While installing everything I mentioned in the "start up stack" I created the basic application mentioned in the "sane stack". Does this mean that the start up stack is stupid or that they are doing it all wrong? Well... no.</p>

<p>Most of them have to handle a different load than I will face in the first few months. And I would not buy an additional server when I encounter the first load problems. I am aware of the possibilities and I can easily separate the backend from the frontend, add a task queue or improve the user experience for big data sets.</p>

<p>Until this happens I do not waste time developing and creating things I may never need. I do not waste time maintaining a stack of frameworks and languages I currently do not need. I keep it small and easy until I need it. But I consider the possibilities and try to make sure I can easily add the option to scale.</p>

<p>Why do I not just create a Django or Flask application for each client? Because using Zenbo, I can just host more small sites on one server. I can keep the hosting and administration costs low. Everyone wins.</p>

<h3>Why Do I Rant About This?</h3>

<p>I have recently talked to some friends who work on their first product and start up. And they fall into the big "everyone is doing it"-trap. Just because other start ups use something does not mean you have to, even if their arguments make sense. They have different needs, they have different engineers, they have different use cases.</p>

<p>The best advices I could give them were</p>

<ul>
<li>keep your stack as small as possible</li>
<li>always keep scaling in mind</li>
<li>only scale when you need it</li>
<li>use what you know</li>
<li>"it works" is good enough most of the time</li>
</ul>

<p>This will not work for everyone, though. Look at App.net for example: They knew that they will face a certain load. It would have made no sense to deliver fast and ignore scaling. The whole business model is build around the fact that they have to grow as fast as possible, which means scaling.</p>

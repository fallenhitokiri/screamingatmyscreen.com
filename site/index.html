            <p class="date">posted on: 11 / 27 / 2012</p>
            <p>Last week I was talking to 14 boys and girls about IT. Their school offered an orientation day and I was invited as a speaker. One of them was especially interested in selling products. Now this is something I wanted to talk about for a long time on my blog. Maybe you remember the <a href="/2012/5/time-to-talk-about-business/">"talk about business"</a> series?

            <p>Some Twitter followers could already know that I am working on a book. Just not what it is about. Big announcement: It will be about web application development using Django. It is supposed to be an easy entry in the world of Django and tries to cover as much as possible in a simple way to get started with the framework.

            <p>Yesterday Apple introduced the iPad mini. As always I had two different types of people in my Twitter timeline. Those who tried to order it before the keynote was finished and those who explained why the iPad mini is a big disappointment. I believe it is great, just not for "us".

            <p>After a week of working on Zenbo (and desperately searching for a new name, as this one is already protected by someone else) there are some news I want to share with you. Sadly not everything worked as expected and there were some private issues I had to take care of. But the good news are that I am on a good track for a release. Let me give you an overview what happened and what you can expect.

            <p>After a week of doing nearly nothing, thanks to a really bad cold, I managed to get some testing and coding done. I thought I give you some updates how your favorite project is doing and how soon you will see the release of the last blogging platform you will ever need.

            <p>I was starting to write a web service using Go this weekend. I already deployed two services replacing a Flask and a Sinatra application but this time was different. It was the first time I found a part in the Go language which did not make sense immediately. Did you ever try to pass a http.Request to a goroutine? Do you want to know what happens if you do?

            <p>Many professionals and Mac Pro owners prayed to see the announcement of a new version of their favorite workstation. The reactions differed between "wow, great, take my money" and "oh no, I know you will mess it up". I think the new Mac Pro is a great systems moving in the right direction but eventually one or two years too early and too dependent on Intel.

            <p>I am not sure if I became one of those "back when I was young everything was better" people or if gaming was just better. Looking at the new Xbox One I have another reason to stay away from gaming consoles, even if I would have enjoyed one. Let me explain why.

            <p>It is all over the news. Yahoo bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion. As usual, after a service is acquired, people fear that Tumblr is dying, starts attaching ads to every <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, changes colors to match Yahoos purple and, of course, someone starts making profit of cat pictures, rants about food and deep, emotional, whiny black and white memes 13 years old use to tell the world their parents do not love them because they bought them the white and not black iPhone.

            <p>Now that the first rage about Adobes move to only offer the Creative Suite based on a subscription model is gone, we should be able to talk about it like sane human beings. Overall I like the idea and I do not believe it will backfire at Adobe.

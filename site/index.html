            <p>Now that the first rage about Adobes move to only offer the Creative Suite based on a subscription model is gone, we should be able to talk about it like sane human beings. Overall I like the idea and I do not believe it will backfire at Adobe.

            <p>This week I have read another article that Google terminated an account without notice and without reason. It described the horrible life without GMail, Picasa, gdrive and all the other services Google offers. The conclusion and the comments were the same I always read when something like this happens: "The cloud is bad!". Wellâ€¦ This is just not true.

            <p>Imagine the following situation. You are hired to develop an application using Ruby on Rails. But from your experience you decide that Sinatra would be better suited for the job. You just develop the application in Sinatra, deliver, no one notices it and everyone seems to be happy. Do you believe this is okay?

            <p>After reading many positive things about the Go language I decided to give it a try. I spent one weekend reading about the basics, some more detailed stuff I am especially interested in and worked my way through the first examples and some tutorials. I have to admit I am a bit torn between "wow, great language" and "meh, not sure if I like it".

            <p>At the moment women in IT is one of the most discussed topics I am aware of. There is no day without new tweets, tumbles and other stuff discussing the topic. After I read <a href="http://ashedryden.com/blog/call-for-perspectives-changing-our-hiring-processes-for-diversity">Ashes</a> post I thought about talking about it from the perspective of an employer and someone who had more hiring talks than you can count the last ten years.

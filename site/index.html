            <p>It was over four weeks ago that I put a small service written in Scala into production. Some people wanted to know how the service is performing and if I would consider using Scala again. Let me give you a short summary.

            <p>Another week with Scala. After ditching the Coursera course I just started working a bit with the language and building some smaller applications. I looked at Scalatra and Play, deployed a test application and finally uninstalled Eclipse. Let us talk about web applications.

            <p>I am a bit late with my week two summary but let's do it anyway. Week three will be ready on Sunday. I stopped attending the Coursera class. I fought against the tools and I even managed to actually learn some Scala.

            <p>I decided to learn Scala. It was more a spontaneous decision than well thought out. I have heard many good things about it, it seems to do a decent job at Twitter, other start-ups and established companies, it runs on top of the JVM and Coursera just started a course "Functional Programming Principles in Scala". I will write a short recap about my journey every weekend.

            <p>I used Sublime Text exclusively for the last two weeks. The major drawback, beside the not really native user interface, was the way jedi works. After tweeting that the integration in vim using YouCompleteMe is way better I received the question how to properly configure Sublime Text to use jedi - let me give you a short walkthrough.

            <p>After a week of working on Zenbo (and desperately searching for a new name, as this one is already protected by someone else) there are some news I want to share with you. Sadly not everything worked as expected and there were some private issues I had to take care of. But the good news are that I am on a good track for a release. Let me give you an overview what happened and what you can expect.

            <p>After a week of doing nearly nothing, thanks to a really bad cold, I managed to get some testing and coding done. I thought I give you some updates how your favorite project is doing and how soon you will see the release of the last blogging platform you will ever need.

            <p>The beta is running pretty great and I am making progress towards a <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/8/14/the_road_to_zenbo_1_0.html">1.0 release candidate</a>. While working on <a href="http://www.hopelesscom.de/2012/9/9/my_stack_is_bigger_than_yours_-_ranting_about_web_applications_and_scalability.html">a project</a> for my company to enable forms and other dynamic features in Zenbo I thought about something totally different. Providing a hosted service for Zenbo. How exactly would this look like?

            <p>Building a web application is serious business. Reading start up blogs, High Scalability or other sites you see many different tools, opinions how stuff should be designed and build, how you should deploy everything and of course even more opinions why this particular stack is superior to everything else. Sadly people who read this believe they have to do the same things and use as many tools as everyone else does.

            <p>In nearly all kinds of media you hear about those obsessed people who are just bad, evil and likely terrorists or psychopaths. Why? Because they are obsessed. What they never tell you is that an obsession can be something great. Not if you want to live a boring, standard life like your neighbor and his neighbor and so on.

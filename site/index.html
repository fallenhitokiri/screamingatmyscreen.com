            <p>Today I am releasing one of my side projects, <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/leeroyci">Leeroy CI</a>. It is a self hosted, continuous integration and build service with the primary goal to be easy to configure and get out of your way while doing its job. And since it is licensed under the BSD license it is also pretty affordable.

            <p>After my <a href="http://screamingatmyscreen.com/2014/5/why-are-so-many-people-writing-static-site-generators/">last post</a> I received a question how to actually write a static site generator. I can see that this sounds like a big project for someone who just starts writing code - but I claimed it would be a good starting project and since I prefer to put my money where my mouth is let me help you getting started.

            <p>Yesterday I was asked this question by <a href="https://twitter.com/hpoom/status/465926128935661568">Simon Wood</a>. While trying to give some reasons in four tweets I think it is a topic I should elaborate. Especially since I am some hours of coding away from releasing the second major release of <a href="http://github.com/fallenhitokiri/drupan">Drupan</a>.

            <p>With colleagues it is sometimes as with babies. Everyone thinks he got the best, cutest and most fun to be around. But honestly: if this would be a game, I would win ;) . On Valentines Day my colleagues surprised me with a self-made telepresence device.

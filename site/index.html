            <p>Imagine the following situation. You are hired to develop an application using Ruby on Rails. But from your experience you decide that Sinatra would be better suited for the job. You just develop the application in Sinatra, deliver, no one notices it and everyone seems to be happy. Do you believe this is okay?

            <p>After reading many positive things about the Go language I decided to give it a try. I spent one weekend reading about the basics, some more detailed stuff I am especially interested in and worked my way through the first examples and some tutorials. I have to admit I am a bit torn between "wow, great language" and "meh, not sure if I like it".

            <p>At the moment women in IT is one of the most discussed topics I am aware of. There is no day without new tweets, tumbles and other stuff discussing the topic. After I read <a href="http://ashedryden.com/blog/call-for-perspectives-changing-our-hiring-processes-for-diversity">Ashes</a> post I thought about talking about it from the perspective of an employer and someone who had more hiring talks than you can count the last ten years.

            <p>Digital Ocean offers cloud servers with SSD storage. Sounds great, right? They also try to be active on many social media channels and sites like Hacker News. They answer support tickets pretty quickly. But I am still not sure if I really want to give them my credit card number. Let me explain what happened.

            <p>There are two types of online service you can use. On one you are the customer on the other you are the product. Lately, thanks to Instagram, there has been a lot of discussion if it is okay to provide a service to people just to sell their informations. Is this a valid business model? Is it the only business model which could work.

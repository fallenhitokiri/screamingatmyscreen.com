            <p>At the moment women in IT is one of the most discussed topics I am aware of. There is no day without new tweets, tumbles and other stuff discussing the topic. After I read <a href="http://ashedryden.com/blog/call-for-perspectives-changing-our-hiring-processes-for-diversity">Ashes</a> post I thought about talking about it from the perspective of an employer and someone who had more hiring talks than you can count the last ten years.

            <p>Digital Ocean offers cloud servers with SSD storage. Sounds great, right? They also try to be active on many social media channels and sites like Hacker News. They answer support tickets pretty quickly. But I am still not sure if I really want to give them my credit card number. Let me explain what happened.

            <p>There are two types of online service you can use. On one you are the customer on the other you are the product. Lately, thanks to Instagram, there has been a lot of discussion if it is okay to provide a service to people just to sell their informations. Is this a valid business model? Is it the only business model which could work.

            <p>I thought a bit about my blog and how blogging changed the last years. One thing I will try to bring back is a short overview what happened the whole week, what was interesting, what was new and what I did. I think this will also be a good way to rant about new projects.

            <p>I used a lot of my time the last two weeks to work on the hosting option for <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/drupan">drupan</a> powered sites. While splitting up tasks in services I thought about all the possibilities how I could host them. I looked at AWS, Heroku, Rackspace and considered renting some dedicated servers from Hetzner. To be honest I am surprised by the outcome. I hope to give you a decent overview and maybe a bit help to decide what works for you if you are in a similar situation.

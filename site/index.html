            <p>Back in 2012 I wrote a <a href="http://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/2012/2/business-decision-why-i-use-django-and-not-ruby-on-rails/">post</a> why my preferred choice for projects I realize with <a href="http://www.blazeit.de">Blaze IT</a> is Django and not Ruby on Rails. Since then it got a lot of attention and is still linked in some discussions and tweets today. People asked me for an update and if it is still relevant, so here we go.

            <p>â€¦ so we put a downloader in your download to download a downloader to download the application you want. I have to admit that I do not like Adobe but they managed to move the current trend of downloading an application to download the application you want to a whole new level of stupidity.

            <p>Last week Amar Bose died. As expected a thread on every major discussion platform emerged. Sadly I have seen the same pointless discussion, as you would normally find in an Apple-centric thread, claiming that people buying Bose or Apple and paying for design are obviously stupid.

            <p>In the past few months we have seen many articles about big companies and well known start-ups rewriting a part of their infrastructure in Go. And all articles have one thing in common. They tell you how much faster the app is, how many servers they could turn off and how awesome Go is. Should you do the same and rewrite your app in Go?

            <p>I was starting to write a web service using Go this weekend. I already deployed two services replacing a Flask and a Sinatra application but this time was different. It was the first time I found a part in the Go language which did not make sense immediately. Did you ever try to pass a http.Request to a goroutine? Do you want to know what happens if you do?

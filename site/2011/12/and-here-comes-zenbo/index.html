    <h1>And here comes Zenbo</h1>
    <p>After some development time, testing, and moving the release date two times I
finally and officially start using <a href="https://github.com/fallenhitokiri/Zenbo" title="Zenbo on GitHub">Zenbo</a> for Hopelesscom. This is the second time 
I use a self written blogging software but this time I used everything I learned from 
my previous mistakes and considered what will work best for the next few years.
<!--MORE--></p>

<p>There is still a lot of stuff to do before I will release version 1.0.</p>

<ul>
<li>plugin system</li>
<li>moving generators to plugins</li>
<li>documentation</li>
<li>default template</li>
<li>usability improvements</li>
<li>nicer urls</li>
<li>RFC conform dates for RSS feeds</li>
<li>logo improvements</li>
<li>better command line parsing and handling</li>
</ul>

<p>But this is nothing that will take forever. Well the default template and the
documentation maybe but everything else should be ready till the end of the month
or early January.</p>

<p>If you want to give Zenbo a try just do it. You can ask me anything you do not
understand after you have read the Readme and took a quick look at the code. If you
just want something that is production ready and feature complete I suggest you wait
some weeks till I release 1.0.</p>

<p>And as a side note: writing a blog post in vim is as awesome as I imagined. I am
not sure if I will stick with vim or move to something with a build in spelling
correction and a bit more polish but everything is better than a creepy web
interface requiring more JavaScript than a bloated browser game.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more news on Zenbo - regular blogging will start in the middle of
next week again. Till then there will be a big "whooo it is released party for a
handful of selected guests",...</p>

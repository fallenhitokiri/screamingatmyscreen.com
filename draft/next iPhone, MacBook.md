title: The next Mac, iPad and iPhone will not be my dream devices

There is a lot speculation what Apple will show us this year. I believe speculations even started a bit earlier than usual. But no matter what they show it will not be what I really want. This is not Apples fault. Scott Hanselman published an [article][1] that made me think what I expect from my tools.

I am a frequent reader of [The Setup][2]. Sometimes it is interesting how other people work, what they consider a productivity increase and what tools they use. Personally I try to use what works for me and what is currently available. I linked Scotts article because some of his points are also what I expect (well, and it is a good read). But every time I think about my setup I think about things that are currently available. What if I could make up some tools and someone would build them for me? What if I could get whatever I want?

To prevent some unnecessary flame wars I should mention that this is a personal choice. I know that many people will disagree and this is okay. Everyone should use what works for them.

I basically want 4 devices. An iPhone, an iPad, a MacBook and some kind of badass server. The iPhone and iPad are fine. Really. I do not want something to change. Of course, I would not argue if there would be a better battery lifetime or if they become lighter. MacBooks are also nearly there. A 15" retina MacBook Air would be cool. 15" with a 1680x1050 resolution is exactly the spot when I do not need a separate screen.

Welcome survivors of the apocalypse. I hope you had a great day. Now back to the usual schedule. I think you had to believe you will die and run around in circles screaming for days to miss the current Instagram shitstorm about the change in their terms of service. There is an old rule "If you do not pay for the product, you are the product" which applies to all the cool start-ups that put a "free" price tag on their service. And that is totally okay.

Now I will not start discussing business strategies and how you could make money with a service. I will also not comment on all the "OMG they will sell pictures of my food and my cat and my cat on my food" tweets I have seen. I want to talk about the fact that sometimes it is okay to be the product. "Why" you may ask. Before you scream crazy talk listen. Before we continue, you should read todays [XKCD comic][xkcd]. As I already said on [Hacker News][hn] this comparison is IMHO not suitable.

If Instagram would start selling my pictures I would lose nothing. I can still view and share my pictures, I still have them on my phone I do not lose anything. The only result would be Instagram making money. 

Now do not directly start telling me that money is bad and that we should get rid of it. We live in a world were we need money. Most start-ups notice this at some point and have to come up with a solutions. Online services run on servers and they have to be paid. Unicorns and magic friendship requests will not host a website.

Would you pay for Instagram? I would not. If you would pay: cool! You obviously cannot live without the service or with its alternatives. But ask yourself how many people would also be willing to pay for Instagram. Even if it is only $1 / month. I guess not enough people would be willing to pay enough to keep the service online. So they need another strategy.

They have one. Advertisement. But what if they would really try to keep the service online with the money they make form selling your pictures? Would be okay for me. They make money, I lose nothing, I can keep using a service, I would not pay for, for free.

Do we have to draw a line somewhere? Of course. Would I think it is okay if Facebook sold my phone number to marketing agencies? No. I still would not lose anything but I would get annoying calls from people who want to sell me stuff I do not want. And guess what: this is the reason why I do not add my phone number to my Facebook profile.

If I want to publish content and own it, I have two options. Host it myself or use a service which charges me a monthly or yearly fee in exchange for providing me a service. They do not need to sell my data. They would even harm themselves if they would start doing so. They get the money from me. I am the customer, not the product.

I just do not get how people, who are obvious sane adults who grew up with the Internet and know how it works, start uploading stuff on free services and wonder when they, on some dark day when all venture capital is burned, need to make money and come up with a way to do so. Sorry but this is just stupid.

If you want to be in control of your data pay for it. If you think your birthday is the most important thing in your life and no one should ever be able to find it out just do not post it on the Internet. Just use your brain.

Now there is something else. They changed the terms of service. As usual someone on the Internet reads them. I do not know who those people are and I hope I will never meet one, they give me the creeps, but they read them. And if they believe something is wrong they do everything to make sure everyone knows about it. And this is a good thing. Saves us all a lot of time.

Now let us assume that Instagram selling our pictures would be the end of the world. Mayans were right, if they sell one of our pictures showing us, hugging our pet while scarifying a virgin on an altar, reciting secret formulas we would drop dead. You have 30 days, one month, to download your pictures, move to another service and delete your account. If you cannot do this in 30 days you seriously have other problems than a picture of your breakfast which is now used in a commercial advertisement.

Services and companies need money. If you do not give them money you are the product. You always have the option to use something else, not use it at all or switch to a payed plan. But please, do not complain if a company starts trying to make money to provide you with a "free" service. Especially not if they give you enough time to act before anything happens.
